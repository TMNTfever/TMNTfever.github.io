        <h1>LION DANCE</h1>
      </header>
      
      <br><img class="calpolylion" src="assets/calpolyliondance.png" alt="Cal Poly Lion Dance"><br>
      <h3>My Lion Dance History</h3>
      <p>I first discovered lion dancing in 2007 while attending <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a>. I saw a group of people practicing for a lion dance performance and being the inquisitive college student, I asked what they were doing. Before I knew it, I joined the school's <a href="https://www.calpolyldt.com/">Lion Dance Team</a>, which was a subsidiary of the <a href="https://www.calpolycsa.org/">Chinese Student Association</a>.</p>
      <p>Like all big men, I was assigned to learning the tail first. After years of performing, exposure to head movements, and a ton of weight loss, I started training as a head. I learned that our specific style was primarily Fut San, with some Hok San thrown in. As younger memebers joined, there was a rising interest into doing more Hok San lion dancing, so I began to study Hok San movements, sequences, and drumming. Having switched my major from Computer Science major to Music Composition, I felt responsible in capturing our lion dance team's band arrangments, as well as newer Hok San ones (at the time, there weren't any western sheet music for such a thing).</p>
      <p>After flunking the university, I spent a couple of years in the nearby public college, <a href="https://www.cuesta.edu/">Cuesta</a>. This allowed me to still lion dance with Cal Poly's team, while improving my GPA. After getting my GPA up, I reapplied to Cal Poly and was denied. I decided to apply to few more universities, and to my surprise I was accepted into <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/">Cal Poly Pomona</a>, which is a sister college to Cal Poly SLO. And much to my surprise, they also had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CSALionDance/">Lion Dance Troupe</a>. Their team was smaller, with their captain graduated the quarter prior, so I decided to join and help them.</p>
      <p>While I was not in charge of booking events, I was put in charge of training the team in all aspects of lion dancing. People started calling me Sifu, and I remained in that role for a few years until my graduation. If anyone is curious, I switched back to Comptuer Science. After leaving California, my old Sifu who lived near Pomona became theirs. He hadn't seen me in a few years, but I was honored when he said, "Hey, when did you get so good at lion dancing?".</a>
      <p>Now that I am husband, father, and senior engineer, I am sad to say I don't lion dance with a group anymore. I do lion dancing for exercise, but haven't performed in over a decade. But even though I'm not active, I am still happy teaching what I know.</p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Why Lion Dance?</h3>
      <p>There are many reasons why people lion dance:
        <table>
          <tr><td>Tradtion</td><td>Bringing good luck and chasing away bad spirits.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Competition</td><td>Competing against rival kung fu schools and seeing who's kung fu is best.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Badass</td><td>People just like to pop off.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Excercise</td><td>I don't know anything that makes you sweat faster than lion dancing.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Music</td><td>Some just like to play in the band. I personally love drumming.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Acting</td><td>Making a Chinese lion costume belieavable requires a lot of work, but it sure pays off.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Comradery</td><td>All of my lion dancing brothers and sisters, we are bonded for life.</td></tr>
        </table>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Beginning Lion Dance</h3>
      <p>If you are interested in lion dancing, then you should first check for existing teams near you. Some lion dance teams are territorial and can get aggressive (this is an extreme case, but I've seen this in person). Look for kung fu schools, bhuddist temples, Chinese student groups in universities, and as a last resort you can ask local Chinese restaurants if they have an annual lion dancing team that blesses their restaurant.</p>
      <p>Whether you have a Sifu or not, I would suggest watching lion dance competitions which has the best of the best. You can learn by emulating at first, and then start injecting your own flair the more comfortable you are with the movements.</p>
      <p>An established group would already have regular clientele. If you're a solo agent, you will need to advertise yourself to restaurants, wedding venues, and to Lunar New Year event organizers. The bare minimum team would be 3 people, 2 for the lion, and a drummer. Optimally, a team should have at least 8 people, 4 for lions, a drummer, cymbal, gong, and a guide for the lions.</p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Avoiding Bad Luck</h3>
      <p>Before doing any lion dancing, you should know the things not to do. Since lions are believed to bring good luck, we should be aware of the things that would bring bad luck.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The number 4 is bad luck in China, similar to 13 in the US. Avoid doing things 4 times in a row.</li>
        <li>Always start things on the left side. Another Chinese superstition.</li>
        <li>Even if you're not Buddhist, it's bad luck and disrespectful for a lion to pass a statue of Buddha without doing three bows to it (heaven, earth, man).</li>
        <li>Avoid the color white. White is meant for funerals. Don't use white banners, white uniforms, or white paint. It's even bad luck to accept money in a white envelope.</li>
        <li>Never step or jump over an unused lion, even its train. This signifies that someone is "above" the lion. And the only one above the lion are gods.</li>
        <li>Never exit a building facing outward. Always exit backwards. If a lion turns their back before leaving, then the evil spirits might come back.</li>
        <li>Never perform in a lion that hasn't been awakened / given a spirit / gone through the dotting ceremony. This is when a dot of red paint is put on each eye, the mirror, back of the horn, ears, tongue, feet, back, and tail. Here is a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88aW9N8ih9o">succinct video</a> of the ceremony. This ceremony is also when a name is given to the lion. It doesn't have to be a Chinese name; my favorite name for a lion I used was Mr. Sparkle lol.</li>
        <li>Never touch the mirror or horn of a lion, unless it's during the awakening ceremony. This effects the lions ability to scare bad spirits away.</li>
        <li>If you are the head of the lion, never stick your arm out of the mouth (super tongue). It's not bad luck or anything, it just looks wrong and it's disrespectful to the audience.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Stances</h3>
      <p>The majority of movements are done in a stance. These stances originate from Kung Fu forms, which is why many Kung Fu schools have a lion dance team. All stance screenshots were created in <a href="https://app.justsketch.me/">JustSketch.me</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <table>
        <tr><td><span>Horse</span>
          <br>A squat where the thighs are parallel to the ground. The legs are typically held wider than a normal squat. Weight is equally distributed between both legs. The lion head could be held up or on shoulder.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="assets/stance-horse.png" alt="Horse"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Crane</span>
          <br>Stand on one leg with the other leg bended as high as possible and toes pointed down. All weight balanced on standing leg. The lion head is held up and pointed down.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="assets/stance-crane.png" alt="Crane"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Cat</span>
          <br>Standing with the back leg slightly bent with the foot fully planted and perpendicular to the body. The front leg is parallel with the body, also slightly bent with only the toes toes touching the floor. 90% - 100% of the weight is on the back leg. The lion head rests on the shoulders.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="assets/stance-cat.png" alt="Cat"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Panther</span>
          <br>A very low stance where one leg is straight and the other is bent. Weight is equally distributed between both legs. The lion head is typically held up.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stance-panther.png" alt="Panther"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Unicorn</span>
          <br>One leg steps over. The back leg is bent with the sole facing away from the direction you're stepping. Weight is equally distributed between both legs. The lion head is held on shoulder, facing the same way as the back leg and downward.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stance-unicorn.png" alt="Unicorn"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Bow</span>
          <br>Like a panther, but standing. Weight is equally distributed between both legs. The lion head is held on-shoulder or held up.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stance-bow.png" alt="Bow"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Arrow</span>
          <br>Similar to Bow stance, except with the torso facing the opposite way. Stand with front leg bent to a 90 degree angle and the back leg is straight back with the foot perpendicular to the body. Weight is equally distributed between both legs. The lion head is held up and forward, or on the shoulders.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stance-arrow.png" alt="Arrow"></td></tr>
      </table>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Movement</h3>
      <p>There are several movements/sequences that are common in all lion dance schools. They might go by different names, but I'll be using names that I've always used.</p>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Running</td><td>It's essentially just trotting while the head bobs left and right while lifted high, or in a diamond motion while holding the head low.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Retreat</td><td>The lion turns sideways and does three hops away from something, while doing back-takes.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Short bows</td><td>Three bows that are done in place, left, right, and left again. The lion dips to to one side, goes up and around toward the front in a circular motion, ending a cat stance.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Medium bows</td><td>Walking forward and then shuffling back, three times.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Long bows</td><td>Approaches followed by a retreat (mentioned later). Done three times.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hop</td><td>A little gallop in place where the lion head pops up and shakes a little.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Licking</td><td>The lion head extends slowly shakes along a leg, typically done three times.</td></tr>
      </table>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Drumming</h3>
      <p>I'll explain all of the different drum sequences on that sheet I linked you. The first ones that aren't numbered are not notated. As for the notation, the regular notes are regular drum hits. The Xs are clicks which are done on the edge of the drum. And the hollow diamonds aren't half notes, they are muted drum hits. The solid diamonds are just mistakes which should just be normal hits. I don't have the notation software anymore to fix them lol.</p>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Heart Beat</td><td>Played throughout the performance and that ties all of the drum sequences together. The drum beat itself sounds like a heart beat, while the cymbals chime on each quarter note, and the gong hits on every other quarter note. The lion is typically just sitting, standing, or walking around with the heartbeat.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Running</td><td>This is played continuously while the lion in doing something more exerting lion running, jumping, or stunting. It sounds like the middle of the Chrysanthemum beat, but played continuously.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Drumroll</td><td>All instruments just play as fast as possible. It can slow down or speed up depending on what the lion is doing. This is usually played for anticipation of something cool, like a big stunt or a lettuce toss.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Chrysanthemum</td><td>This is an intro beat into different parts of the performance. The lion is usually dancing in place, bobbing left and right, and then hops when there's a rest on the 7th measure.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Middle Testing</td><td>Testing in general is the cat-like curiosity I was talking about about. The lion extends the head in a circular motion around the object it's investigating, and then hops at the ends to show the dog-like excitement.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Investigative Step</td><td>The lion approaches and steps with every beat in the first several measures. Then hops in circular motion around the object before either laying down, sitting, or retreating.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Ending</td><td>Done at end of sequences to give the lion time to get ready for the next sequence. There are no specific movements to it.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Lower Testing</td><td>Three approaches which have three nods, alternating sides. And in between, there are hops. This is when the lion amping up in excitement for an object.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Forward Testing</td><td>The lion is now really excited for an object and about to pick it up. The head will extend over the object and shake side to side, then end with a hop.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Climbing the Mountain</td><td>This sequence is reserved for doing a long sequence of stunts. Nothing specific.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Lion Scratching</td><td>The lion approaches an object and will turn sideways and scratch its side and then leap away. This is done three times.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Jumping</td><td>This is three sets of Jump Kicks.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Half Testing</td><td>This is just an approach without the investigation. It's kinda like a tease.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Retreating</td><td>This is a very old sequence that not many teams do anymore. The lion turns sideways and jumps away three times while doing double-takes.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Taunting</td><td>Exactly what the name implies. This can involved biting and kicks.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7 Stars</td><td>This is specific to my team which involves three sets of unicorn steps and blinks, followed by sweeping shakes, ending in a hop. We used this as another test just to mix things up. You don't always do all the tests, just two or three.</td></tr>      </table>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Stunts</h3>
      <p>What everyone loves to see and the hardest things to do - the stunts. These require the head to wear a sturdy sash for the tail to lift them and assist with jumping. All stunt screenshots were created in <a href="https://app.justsketch.me/">JustSketch.me</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <table>
        <tr><td><span>Head Sit</span>
          <br>The head is assisted in jumping onto the tail's head. The head's front leg will be similar to a cat stance, while the back leg is bent and perpendicular to the body, resting on the tail's chest.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-head.png" alt="Head Sit"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Shoulder Stand</span>
          <br>What the name implies, and is used to reach really high changs. Not normally done in one motion like cheerleaders, because of the added weight. This can be transitioned to from a head sit, or done as a climb. The climb is complicated and only done by experienced dancers. For the climb, the tail will detach themselves from the costume, and then gets into horse stance. The head runs around and behind the tail using them as 2-step ladder; first step being the thighs and second being the shoulders. This should be implied, but the climb is done without the use of the head's hands.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-shoulder.png" alt="Shoulder Stand"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Single Stand</span>
          <br>The head jumps and gets into a crane stance. The tail lifts and gets in to arrow stance, and sets the head's single foot onto their front thigh.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-single.png" alt="Single Stand"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Jump Kick</span>
          <br>The head jumps as high as they can. The tail lifts them as high as they can. And the head kicks their legs in a V shape. This is done in place.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-kick.png" alt="Jump Kick"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Leap</span>
          <br>Just a big jump forward for both the head and tail. The head jumps as high as they can, and the the tail lifts and pushes them forward. The tail takes a step before leaping as well. This is done to jump over a large gap, and essential when doing stilt work.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-leap.png" alt="Leap"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Lap Stand</span>
          <br>The head does a short hop with legs shoulder width apart. The tail aims the head's feet onto their thighs while in horse stance.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-lap.png" alt="Lap Stand"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Swing</span>
          <br>Done from a Lap Stand. The head drops down from standing and then wraps their legs around the tail's waist while the tail shifts their balance backwards. The head then swings downward in a circular motion and uses the momentum to get back onto the Lap Stand. To support the swing, the tail can support the head by hugging them around the hips, waist, or chest.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-swing1.png" alt="Swing1">
          <br><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-swing2.png" alt="Swing2"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Forward Tumble</span>
          <br>Done from a Lap Stand. The head goes into a swing motion, but instead tucks to one side to roll. The tail has to control the tumble so that the lion head doesn't get scraped or hit, and then follows with a shoulder roll. The tail should end up lying on their back, and the head ends up standing up just above the tail who's lying down. To finish, the head needs to take a big hop forward to get back in front of the tail, who then can bend forward and sit/stand up.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-tumble.png" alt="Forward Tumble"></td></tr>
        <tr><td><span>Side Roll</span>
          <br>Done with both head and tail in panther stance. They both then roll onto their backs to the opposite side panther stance.</td>
          <td><img class="stance" src="/assets/stunt-roll.png" alt="Side Roll"></td></tr>

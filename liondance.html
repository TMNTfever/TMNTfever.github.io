      <h3>My Lion Dance History</h3>
      <p>I first discovered lion dancing in 2007 while attending <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a>. I saw a group of people practicing for a lion dance performance and being the inquisitive college student, I asked what they were doing. Before I knew it, I joined the school's <a href="https://www.calpolyldt.com/">Lion Dance Team</a>, which was a subsidiary of the <a href="https://www.calpolycsa.org/">Chinese Student Association</a>.</p>
      <p>Like all big men, I was assigned to learning the tail first. After years of performing, exposure to head movements, and a ton of weight loss, I started training as a head. I learned that our specific style was primarily Fut San, with some Hok San thrown in. As younger memebers joined, there was a rising interest into doing more Hok San lion dancing, so I began to study Hok San movements, sequences, and drumming. Having switched my major from Computer Science major to Music Composition, I felt responsible in capturing our lion dance team's band arrangments, as well as newer Hok San ones (at the time, there weren't any western sheet music for such a thing).</p>
      <p>After flunking the university, I spent a couple of years in the nearby public college, <a href="https://www.cuesta.edu/">Cuesta</a>. This allowed me to still lion dance with Cal Poly's team, while improving my GPA. After getting my GPA up, I reapplied to Cal Poly and was denied. I decided to apply to few more universities, and to my surprise I was accepted into <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/">Cal Poly Pomona</a>, which is a sister college to Cal Poly SLO. And much to my surprise, they also had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CSALionDance/">Lion Dance Troupe</a>. Their team was smaller, with their captain graduated the quarter prior, so I decided to join and help them.</p>
      <p>While I was not in charge of booking events, I was put in charge of training the team in all aspects of lion dancing. People started calling me Sifu, and I remained in that role for a few years until my graduation. If anyone is curious, I switched back to Comptuer Science. After leaving California, my old Sifu who lived near Pomona became theirs. He hadn't seen me in a few years, but I was honored when he said, "Hey, when did you get so good at lion dancing?".</a>
      <p>Now that I am husband, father, and senior engineer, I am sad to say I don't lion dance with a group anymore. I do lion dancing for exercise, but haven't performed in over a decade. But even though I'm not active, I am still happy teaching what I know.</p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Beginning Lion Dance</h3>
      <p>If you are interested in lion dancing, then you should first check for existing teams near you. Some lion dance teams are territorial and can get aggressive (this is an extreme case, but I've seen this in person). Look for kung fu schools, bhuddist temples, Chinese student groups in universities, and as a last resort you can ask local Chinese restaurants if they have an annual lion dancing team that blesses their restaurant.</p>
      <p>Whether you have a Sifu or not, I would suggest watching lion dance competitions which has the best of the best. You can learn by emulating at first, and then start injecting your own flair the more comfortable you are with the movements.</p>
      <p>An already established group would already have regular clientele. If you're a solo agent, you will need to advertise yourself to restaurants, wedding venues, and to Lunar New Year event organizers. The bare minimum team would be 3 people, 2 for the lion, and a drummer. Optimally, a team should have at least 8 people, 4 for lions, a drummer, cymbal, gong, and a guide for the lions.</p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Avoiding Bad Luck</h3>
      <p>Before doing any lion dancing, you should know the things not to do. Since lions are believed to bring good luck, we should be aware of the things that would bring bad luck.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The number 4 is bad luck in China, similar to 13 in the US. Avoid doing things 4 times in a row.</li>
        <li>Always start things on the left side. Another Chinese superstition.</li>
        <li>Even if you're not Buddhist, it's bad luck and disrespectful for a lion to pass a statue of Buddha without doing three bows to it (heaven, earth, man).</li>
        <li>Avoid the color white. White is meant for funerals. Don't use white banners, white uniforms, or white paint. It's even bad luck to accept money in a white envelope.</li>
        <li>Never step or jump over an unused lion, even its train. This signifies that someone is "above" the lion. And the only one above the lion are gods.</li>
        <li>Never exit a building facing outward. Always exit backwards. If a lion turns their back before leaving, then the evil spirits might come back.</li>
        <li>Never perform in a lion that hasn't been awakened / given a spirit / gone through the dotting ceremony. This is when a dot of red paint is put on each eye, the mirror, back of the horn, ears, tongue, feet, back, and tail. Here is a good succinct video of the ceremony. This ceremony is also when a name is given to the lion. It doesn't have to be a Chinese name; my favorite name for a lion I used was Mr. Sparkle lol.</li>
        <li>Never touch the mirror or horn of a lion, unless it's during the awakening ceremony. This effects the lions ability to scare bad spirits away.</li>
        <li>If you are the head of the lion, never stick your arm out of the mouth (super tongue). It's not bad luck or anything, it just looks wrong and it's disrespectful to the audience.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Stances</h3>
      <p>The majority of movements are done in a stance. These stances originate from Kung Fu forms, which is why many Kung Fu schools have a lion dance team.</p>
      </ul>
        <li>Horse - A squat where the thighs are parallel to the ground. The legs are typically held wider than a normal squat. The lion head could be held up or on shoulder.</li>
        <li>Crane - Stand on one leg with the other leg bended as high as possible and toes pointed down. The lion head is held up and pointed down.</li>
        <li>Cat - Standing with the back leg slightly bent with the foot fully planted and perpendicular to the body. The front leg is parallel with the body, also slightly bent with only the toes toes touching the floor. The lion head rests on the shoulders.</li>
        <li>Panther - A very low stance where one leg is straight and the other is bent. The lion head is typically held up.</li>
        <li>Unicorn - One leg steps over. The back leg is bent with the sole facing away from the direction you're stepping. The lion head is held on shoulder, facing the same way as the back leg and downward.</li>
        <li>Bow - Like a panther, but standing. The lion head is held on-shoulder or held up.</li>
        <li>Arrow - Standing with front leg bent to a 90 degree angle and the back leg is straight back with the foot perpendicular to the body. The lion head is held up and forward.</li>
      </ul>

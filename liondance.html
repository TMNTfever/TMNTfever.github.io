      <h3>My Lion Dance History</h3>
      <p>I first discovered lion dancing in 2007 while attending <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a>. I saw a group of people practicing for a lion dance performance and being the inquisitive college student, I asked what they were doing. Before I knew it, I joined the school's <a href="https://www.calpolyldt.com/">Lion Dance Team</a>, which was a subsidiary of the <a href="https://www.calpolycsa.org/">Chinese Student Association</a>.</p><br>
      <p>Like all big men, I was assigned to learning the tail first. After years of performing, exposure to head movements, and a ton of weight loss, I started training as a head. I learned that our specific style was primarily Fut San, with some Hok San thrown in. As younger memebers joined, there was a rising interest into doing more Hok San lion dancing, so I began to study Hok San movements, sequences, and drumming. Having switched my major from Computer Science major to Music Composition, I felt responsible in capturing our lion dance team's band arrangments, as well as newer Hok San ones (at the time, there weren't any western sheet music for such a thing).</p>
      <p>After flunking the university, I spent a couple of years in the nearby public college, <a href="https://www.cuesta.edu/">Cuesta</a>. This allowed me to still lion dance with Cal Poly's team, while improving my GPA. After getting my GPA up, I reapplied to Cal Poly and was denied. I decided to apply to few more universities, and to my surprise I was accepted into <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/">Cal Poly Pomona</a>, which is a sister college to Cal Poly SLO. And much to my surprise, they also had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CSALionDance/">Lion Dance Troupe</a>. Their team was smaller, with their captain graduated the quarter prior, so I decided to join and help them.</p>
      <p>While I was not in charge of booking events, I was put in charge of training the team in all aspects of lion dancing. People started calling me Sifu, and I remained in that role for a few years until my graduation. If anyone is curious, I switched back to Comptuer Science. After leaving California, my old Sifu who lived near Pomona became theirs. He hadn't seen me in a few years, but I was honored when he said, "Hey, when did you get so good at lion dancing?".</a>
      <p>Now that I am husband, father, and senior engineer, I am sad to say I don't lion dance with a group anymore. I do lion dancing for exercise, but haven't performed in over a decade. But even though I'm not active, I am still happy teaching what I know.</p>

      <h3>Beginning Lion Dance</h3>
      <p>If you are interested in lion dancing, then you should first check for existing teams near you. Some lion dance teams are territorial.</p>

  Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, 
C            Gm              F      Fm
  Jack Frost nipping at your nose,
C          Dm           Em        B7
  Yuletide carols being sung by a choir, 
      E             Fm4         G     G7
  And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

  Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe,

  Help to make the season bright, 
C      Dm              Em         B7
  Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow, 
               Dm  F           C       C7
  Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

  They know that San-ta's on his way 
              Gm               C7             Dm
  He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh, 
F            Fm            Bb        Eb    Bb
  And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy, 
            A7              E7          A7    G7
  To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

      C      Dm            Em              Dm
  And so I'm offering this simple phrase, 
     C         Gm            F     Fm
  To kids from one to ninety-two, 
    C                Dm         Em          B7
  Although it's been said, many times, many ways
        F        G   C     Dm Em Dm
  Merry Christmas to you.
        F        G   C     Em C C
  Merry Christmas to you.

<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
G                          D
  My head is stuck in the clouds.
G                    D            Em          D       C
  She begs me to come down says, "Boy, quit foolin' around."
     D       G                          D
  I told her, "I love the view from up here.
G                              D
  The warm sun and wind in my ear.
        Em        D           C           D7                    G  G7
  We'll watch the world from above, as it turns to the rhythm of love.

  We may only have tonight,
               C                   G    B7  Em 
  'Til the morning sun you're mine, all mine.
           D     C        D7                  G
  Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love."

<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
G                        D
  My heart beats like a drum.
G                         D       Em        D           C
  A guitar string to the strum, a beautiful song to be sung.
  D        G                        D
  She's got blue eyes deep like the sea.
G                                         D       
  That roll back when she's laughing at me,
      Em    D           C         D                   G
  She rises up like the tide, the moment her lips meet mine

  We may only have tonight,
               C                   G    B7  Em 
  'Til the morning sun you're mine, all mine.
           D     C        D7                  G
  Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love."

<span>[BRIDGE]</span>
B7         Em      G     D
  When the moon is low
B7       Em       G    D C
  We can dance in slow motion,
               D             C                  D7             G
  And all your fears will subside, and all your tears... will dry.

      Em          D         C         D                    G

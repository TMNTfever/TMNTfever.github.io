  Last Christmas I gave you my heart

D
  Once bitten and twice shy
Bm
  I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Em
  Tell me baby do you recognize me?
A
  Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
D
  "Merry Christmas!" I wrapped it up and sent it
Bm
  With a note saying: "I love you!", I meant it
  Em
  Now I know what a fool I've been
             A
  But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
D
  Crowded room, friends with tired eyes
Bm
  Hiding from you and your soul of ice
Em
  My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
  A
  Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
    D
  A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
    Bm
  A man undercover but you tore him apart
Em
  Now I've found a real love
               A
  You'll never fool me again

  Last Christmas I gave you my heart

  I'll give it to someone special

[VERSE 1]
D
 Once bitten and twice shy
Bm                                        [ Em ]
 I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Em
 Tell me baby do you recognize me?
A
 Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
D
 "Merry Christmas!" I wrapped it up and sent it
 (whispered)
Bm
With a note saying: "I love you!", I meant it
Em
Now I know what a fool I've been
           A
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[CHORUS 2]

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

But the very next day you gave it away
Em
This year to save me from tears
     A
I'll give it to someone special
D
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
        Bm
But the very next day you gave it away
Em
This year to save me from tears
     A
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 3]
D
 Crowded room, friends with tired eyes
Bm
 Hiding from you and your soul of ice
Em
 My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
A
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
 
[Verse 4]
  D
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
  Bm                                    [ Em ]
A man undercover but you tore him apart
                        (To-o-ore   me  apa-art)
Em
    Ooh-hoo
         A
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again
 
[Chorus]
D
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
        Bm
But the very next day you gave it away
Em
This year to save me from tears
     A
I'll give it to someone special
 
[Chorus]
D
Last Christmas I gave you my heart

But the very next day you gave it away

This year to save me from tears
     A
I'll give it to someone special
 
[Verse 5]
  D
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

A man undercover but you tore him apart
Em
 Maybe ... next year ...
(spoken)
     A                                              [ D ]
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone ... special

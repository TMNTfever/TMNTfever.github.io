D                       A
  When you feel you're alone
Bm7                 G
  Cut off from this cruel world
D                A             G
  Your instincts telling you to run
D                A
  listen to your heart
Bm7           G
  those angel voices
D                 A                    G
  they'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home

     D    A         Bm7    G
when life leaves us blind

it keeps us kind

  and your spirit is breaking
D                A                  G
  you're growing desperate from the fights
D                 A
  remember you're loved
Bm7                   G
  and you always will be
D          A                 G
  this melody will bring you right back home

when life leaves us blind

when life leaves us blind

love keeps us kind

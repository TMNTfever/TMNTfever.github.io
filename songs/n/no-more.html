So what, playa chill now
Tell me how you gon' cite me when I found out
Honey gotta break it down, down
I said it ain't no thing
Girl, what's my name?
Kiely, Kiely
Look me in the face and tell me
What the dealie, dealie
Oh, you wanna go shade now
But I'm paid now, I know that you hate that
Oh, you got the one now, you warm now
Cuz you thought you'd come right back, save that
You could do whatever to me, and be together with me
Like you do better than me (you do or you don't)
No more, never for me

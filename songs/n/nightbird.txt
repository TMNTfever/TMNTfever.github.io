[VERSE 1]
  CM7                    Dm7     G7               F      C
  Fly on through the night wind, take a star to her for me

  Here it seems so cold now, how I miss her arms around me
  CM7                 Dm7  G7                 C        C7
  Soar, nightbird of love, make her wait for me, cause you have

      F*             CM7*              D7                   G7
  But loneliness can dull the shine of even the bright moonlight

  CM7               Dm7    G7              C         C7
  And if you can find her, tell her I am true, cause you have

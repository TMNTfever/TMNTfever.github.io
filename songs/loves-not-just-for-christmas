[VERSE 1]
I filled your stocking to the very top
Put your coffee in a Christmas cup
And the children sing as the church bells ring everywhere
Everyone's about the peace on Earth
A little Christmassing for what it's worth
And the whole world smiles
There′s only love in the air
Snow fall faster, go get santa now


[CHORUS 1]
Christmas, wrap it and send it
Christmas, however you spend it
Make December last forever, whoa!
Christmas, love one another
Christmas, a spell that we're under
Make December last forever, whoa!
Cause love′s not just for Christmas


[VERSE 2]
I put a lot of tinsel on the tree
Bought a turkey and some brandy cream
And my mistletoe is hanging in the hope of a kiss
Snow fall faster , go get santa now


[CHORUS 2]
Christmas, wrap it and send it
Christmas, however you spend it
Make December last forever, whoa!
Christmas, love one another
Christmas, a spell that we're under
Make December last forever, whoa!
Cause love′s not just for Christmas


[BRIDGE]
All that you wish for (Christmas)
Is right outside your door family, friends
Everyone you depend on is here, yeah


[CHORUS 3]
Christmas, wrap it and send it
Christmas, however you spend it
Make December last forever, whoa!
Christmas, love one another
Christmas, a spell that we're under
Make December last forever, whoa!
Cause love′s not just for Christmas


[OUTRO]
Love's not just for Christmas
Love's not just for Christmas

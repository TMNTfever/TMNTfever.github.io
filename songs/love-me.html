[VERSE 1]
         GM7                     Em7
  Wait a minute, stop what we're doing
               Am7                              Bm7
  Because I've got to tell you now what's on my mind
             GM7                              Em7
  We've been at this for some time and I just want to know
          Am7                                D7
  If your heart is feeling just as strong as mine
             GM7                Em7
  Cause even though we got some years in this
                    Am7
  It's always brand new to me
          Bm7
  See the butterflies, my palms get sweaty
GM7
  My thoughts and my heart stay heavy
Em7                         Am7            D7
  You've got this kind of effect on me. So maybe we can, we can


[REFRAIN]
  C                 Cm7
  Sit down and just wind down
      GM7                           Em7
  And speak of all the many reasons why we stick around
      Am7                      D7
  But really all I want, all I want from you is just to


[CHORUS]
  GM7      Em7               Am7
  Love me, love me a little more tonight
  Bm7                     GM7
  Say that your heart belongs to me
        Em7                       D7
  Cause my heart is yearning for you
  Am7                     GM7
  Baby I'm forever loving you
   
(Repeat Chorus)


[VERSE 2]
       GM7                                 Em7
  Imma hold you down tomorrow, more than I held you down today
         Am7                        Bm7
  When I say it's you, I mean it, I mean it, he means it
GM7                      Em7
  I'm not gonna slip away when things get harder
     Am7                                D7
  Because the way my heart is built for you
       GM7                                Em7
  This love will never fail. You know I'm planning on forever
       Am7                          Bm7
  It's you, it's me, it's us You're not alone, no, never
GM7                       Em7
  I could go on and on of what this is and promises
Am7                       D7
  Well baby we've got time. So let's just


(Refrain)

(Chorus x2, omit last GM7)


[BRIDGE]
CM7                  Cm7
  Let's just sit down and as we wind down
      GM7                           Em7
  And speak of all the many reasons why we stick around
      Am7                      D7
  But really all I want, all I want from you is just to


(Chorus x2)

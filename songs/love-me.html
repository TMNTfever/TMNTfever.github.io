Love Me - Fia

[Chords]



[Intro]
G  A7


[Verse 1]
D
Wait a minute, stop what we're doing
Bm
Because I've got to tell you now what's on my mind
Em
We've been at this for some time and I just want to know
A
If your heart is feeling just as strong as mine


D
Cause even though we got some years in this
                  Bm
It's always brand new to me
 
See the butterflies, my palms get sweaty
Em
My thoughts and my heart stay heavy
                         A
You've got this kind of effect on me. So maybe we can, we can


[Refrain]
G                        Gm
Sit down and just wind down
     D                            Bm
And speak of all the many reasons why we stick around
     Em                     A
But really all I want, all I want from you is just to


[Chorus]
D                         Bm
Love me, love me a little more tonight
                            Em
Say that your heart belongs to me
                                 A
Cause my heart is yearning for you
                         D
Baby I'm forever loving you
 

(Chorus Repeat)


[Verse 2]
D
Imma hold you down tomorrow, more than I held you down today
       Bm
When I say it's you, I mean it, I mean it, he means it
Em
I'm not gonna slip away when things get harder
  A
Because the way my heart is built for you
 

D
This love will never fail. You know I'm planning on forever
Bm
It's you, it's me, it's us You're not alone, no, never
Em
I could go on and on of what this is and promises
A
Well baby we've got time. So let's just


(Pre-Chorus)


(Chorus x2)
 
 
[Bridge]
G                        A7
Let's just sit down and as we wind down
     D                            Bm
And speak of all the many reasons why we stick around
     Em                     A
But really all I want, all I want from you is just to


(Chorus x2)

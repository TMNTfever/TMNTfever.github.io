  I know I want you here beside me
G                               Bm7
  I know I’ll never get over you, I know I’m pretty damn selfish too

  I know I’ll take good care of you

  If the world ever took you ‘way from me
           C              D    Em
  I would die crying for eternity
           C            D       Em
  Now we wait for us to say, “I do”
             C        D        (G)
  Then we’ll kiss and say, “I love you”

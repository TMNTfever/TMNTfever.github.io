[VERSE 1]
D           Ga9          Em7             G       A         D
  Saying "I love you" is not the words I want to hear from you
D                 Ga9       Em7               G     A    Bm
  It's not that I want you. Not to say, but if you only knew
  F#m7 Em7 A               D       A       Bm
  How easy it would be to show me how you feel

[CHORUS 1]
  F#m7       Em7     A                D7            G  
  More than words is all you have to do to make it real
           Gm7              D            Bm            Em7   A      D
  Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, cause I'A already know
                 A        Bm        F#m7    G
  What would you do if my heart was torn in two
                     D        Em7             A              D
  More than words to show you feel, that your love for me is real
                 A        Bm         F#m7  G
  What would you say if I took those words away
                    D           Em7           A              D
  Then you couldn't make things new, just by saying "I love you"

[VERSE 2]
D               Ga9      Em7              G        A    D  
  Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
D         Ga9           Em7                 G          A        Bm
  All you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hand
  F#m7      Em7 A                    D    A      Bm
  And touch me, hold me close don't ever let me go

[CHORUS 2]
  F#m7       Em7     A                D7            G  
  More than words is all you have to do to make it show
           Gm7              D            Bm            Em7   A      D
  Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, cause I'A already know
                 A        Bm        F#m7    G
  What would you do if my heart was torn in two
                     D        Em7             A              D
  More than words to show you feel, that your love for me is real
                 A        Bm         F#m7  G
  What would you say if I took those words away
                    D           Em7           A              D
  Then you couldn't make things new, just by saying "I love you"

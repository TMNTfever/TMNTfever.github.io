   I don't want this night to end

It's closing time, so leave with me again, yeah
Dm         C                Gm
   You got all my love to spend, oh

            Dm                       C
We're gonna dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Gm
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ay)
     Dm                        C
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Gm
Drunk to an 80s groove (Ay)
            Dm                       C

          Dm    C                       Gm
It's only human when you know that it's real
                 Dm                C                   Gm
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
                  Dm      C                Gm
Oh babe you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
   Dm                     C                     Gm
So stop pretending you're shy, just come on and dance, dance, dance, dance

Only getting up to close the blinds, oh
Dm              C                      Gm
   I'm praying you don't change your mind
                                    Dm
'Cause leaving now just don't feel right

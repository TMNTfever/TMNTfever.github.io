   B                 Em                  D      A        D
  Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

  Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light

  While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love

     B              Em               D         A      D
  So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His Heaven
     Bm               F#          G                F#
  No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin

     Bm                 F#           G                  F#
  We hear the Christmas angels their great glad tidings tell
    D       D7   G                D      A   D
  O come to us, abide with us our Lord Emmanuel

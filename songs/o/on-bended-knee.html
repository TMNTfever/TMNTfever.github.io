          AM7            C#7                 Bm7                   Es4           E
  Darlin' I, I can't explain, where did we lose our way, girl it's drivin' me insane
        AM7                                  C#7
  And I know I just need one more chance, to prove my love to you
         Bm7                                           Es4             E
  And if you come back to me, I'll guarantee, that I'll never let you go

[CHORUS 1]
         A              A7             D        D/E
  Can we go back to the days our love was strong
          A             A7              D      D/E
  Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
               A              F#7                 D                Dm
  Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they use to be
     C#m7
  Oh god give me a reason, I'm down on bended knee

[INTERLUDE 1]

  I'll never walk again until you come back to me, I'm down on bended knee

[VERSE 2]

  So many nights I dream of you, holding my pillow tight and I know, I don't need to be alone

  When I open up my eyes to face reality

  Every moment without you, it seems like eternity, I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

[CHORUS 2]

[INTERLUDE 2]
Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

[BRIDGE]
I'm gonna swallow my pride, say I'm sorry, stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life, and I want it with you, if you feel the same, don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love, it'll heal all things, it won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please come home

[CHORUS 3] x 2

[OUTRO]
I'll never walk again
Till you come back to me
I'm down on bended knees

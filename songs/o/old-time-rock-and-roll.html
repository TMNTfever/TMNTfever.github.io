Just take those old records off the shelf
                           G
I’ll sit and listen to ’em by myself
                    A
Today’s music ain’t got the same soul
                     D
I like that old time rock and roll
 
<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
A8                        D
Don’t try to take me to a disco
                         G
You’ll never even get me out on the floor
                      A
In 10 minutes I’ll be late for the door
                     D
I like that old time rock and roll

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
A                        D
Still like that old time rock and roll
                        G
That kind of music just soothes the soul
                      A
I reminisce about the days of old
                   D             A
with that old time rock and roll

<s->[VERSE 3]</s->
A                           D
Won’t go to hear ’em play a tango
                              G
I’d rather hear some blues or funky old soul
                             A
There’s only one sure way to get me to go
                       D
Start playing old time rock and roll

<s->[VERSE 4]</s->
                         D
Call me a relic, call me what you will
                               G
Say I’m old-fashioned, say I’m over the hill
                    A
Today’s music ain’t got the same soul
                     D
I like that old time rock and roll

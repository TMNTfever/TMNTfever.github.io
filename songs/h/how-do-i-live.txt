          E                B                              F#m
  How do I get through one night without you, if I had to live without you
               Bs4                         E                  B
  What kind of life would that be, oh and I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold
            A                            G#m7     C#m7
  You're my world, my heart, my soul, if you ever leave
  F#m7                                G#m7       C#m7 As4
  Baby you would take away everything good in my life, and tell me now

  How do I live without you, I want to know

  How do I breathe without you if you ever go

  How do I ever, ever survive

  Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky, there would be no love in my life
                Bs4                     E              B
  There'd be no world left for me, and I, baby I don't know what I would do
         A                      G#m7     C#m7
  I'd be lost if I lost you, if you ever leave
  F#m7                                G#m7       C#m7 As4
  Baby you would take away everything real in my life, and tell me now

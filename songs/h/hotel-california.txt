[VERSE 1]
Am                         E7
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                          C
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm                                        E7
  My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night

Am                               E7
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
G                                             D
  And I was thinking to myself, this could be heaven or this could be hell
F                          C
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Dm                                   E7
  There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say

[CHORUS 1]
F                          C
  Welcome to the Hotel California
         E7                                          Am
  Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
  F                               C
  Plenty of room at the Hotel California
      Dm                                       E7
  Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here

[VERSE 2]
Am                             E7
  Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes bends
G                                     D
  She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
F                                   C
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Dm                       E7
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

Am                           E7
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine, he said
G                                      D
  We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
F                                         C
  And still those voices are calling from far away
Dm                                      E7
  Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say

[CHORUS 2]
F                          C
  Welcome to the Hotel California
         E7                                          Am
  Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
          F                             C
  They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
         Dm                                               E7
  What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis

[VERSE 3]
Am                        E7
  Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice, and she said
G                                D
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
F                              C
  And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Dm                                              E7
  They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast

Am                             E7
  Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
G                                       D
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
F                                   C
  "Relax" said the night man, we are programmed to receive
Dm                                   E7
  You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave

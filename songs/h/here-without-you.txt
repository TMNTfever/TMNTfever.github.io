  A hundred days have made me older, since the last time that I saw your pretty face
             Am                                  G                               Am  F | G
  A thousand lies have made me colder, and I don't think I can look at this the same
Am                            G  Am                                F        G
  But all the miles that seperate, they dissapear now, when I'm dreaming of your face

  The miles just keep rollin', as the people leave their way to say hello
                  Am                         G                             Am     F |  G

Am                           C                             (G)

  Am  F | G

<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
            Am                                    G                              Am  F | G
  A hundred days have made me older, since the last time that I saw your pretty face
             Am                                  G                               Am  F | G
  A thousand lies have made me colder, and I don't think I can look at this the same
Am                            G  Am                                F        G
  But all the miles that seperate, they dissapear now, when I'm dreaming of your face

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
C                          G                                Am
  I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind
                          F           G                  (C)
  I think about you baby, and I dream about you all the time
C                          G                                    Am
  I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams
          F    G                    Am
  And tonight, there's only you and me

<s->[INTERLUDE 1]</s->
  G   Am  F | G
  Yeah

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
      Am                                 G                              Am  F | G
  The miles just keep rollin', as the people leave their way to say hello
                  Am                         G                             Am     F |  G

  Everything I know, and anywhere I go, it gets hard but it won't take away my love
Am                           C                             (G)
  And when the last one falls, and when it's all said and done
G                              F            F      C
  It gets hard, but it won't take away my love, whoa

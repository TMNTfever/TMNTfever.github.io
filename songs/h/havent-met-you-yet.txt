[VERSE 1]
C            F                      Dm
  I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
                    Am          G                 C
  I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
                F                      Dm
  Talked myself in, I've talked myself out
                    Am             G         (Dm)
  I get all worked up and then I let myself down

[REFRAIN 1]
Dm                Em                  Dm                  G
  I tried so very hard not to lose it, and came up with a million excuses
Dm                   Em                    F  G
  I thought I've thought of every possibility

[CHORUS 1]
                  F               G       C
  And I know someday that it'll all turn out
                   F               G              Am
  You'll make me work, so we can work to work it out
          F          G             Am           Em           F
  And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
    G                    (C)
  I just haven't met you yet

[VERSE 2]
C                 F                     Dm
  I might have to wait, I'll never give up
                     Am            G            C
  I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
               F                  Dm
  Wherever you are, whenever it's right
                   Am          G     (Dm)
  You came out of nowhere and into my life

  I know that we can be so amazing, and baby your love's gonna change me

  And now I can see every possibility

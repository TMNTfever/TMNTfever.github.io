  It's not in the way that you hold me
Am7               Bm7             Em7  Bm7 A#m7
  It's not in the way you say you care
Am7               Bm7             CM7         D7      Bm7 A#m7

Am7               Bm7          CM7             D7  Bm7 A#m7
  It's not in the way that you stayed till the end

  It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Am7               Bm7          CM7          D7 Bm7 A#m7

Am7               Bm7            CM7          D7 Bm7 A#m7
  It's not in the way that your love set me free

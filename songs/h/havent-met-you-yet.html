<s->[INTRO]</s-> x 2
  C  F  Dm  Am | G

<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
C            F                      Dm
  I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
                    Am          G                 C
  I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
                F                      Dm
  Talked myself in, I've talked myself out
                    Am             G          Dm
  I get all worked up and then I let myself down 
 
<s->[REFRAIN 1]</s->
(Dm)              Em                  Dm                  G
  I tried so very hard not to lose it, and came up with a million excuses
Dm                   Em                    F  G
  I thought I've thought of every possibility

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
                  F               G       C
  And I know someday that it'll all turn out
                   F               G              Am
  You'll make me work, so we can work to work it out
          F          G             Am           Em           F
  And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
    G                    INTRO
  I just haven't met you yet

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
C                 F                     Dm
  I might have to wait, I'll never give up
                     Am            G            C
  I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
               F                  Dm
  Wherever you are, whenever it's right
                   Am          G      Dm
  You came out of nowhere and into my life
 
<s->[REFRAIN 2]</s->
(Dm)                 Em            Dm             G
  I know that we can be so amazing, and baby your love's gonna change me
Dm             Em                    F  G
  And now I can see every possibility

<r->[CHORUS 2]</r->
  (Same as Chorus 1, but don't end with INTRO)

<s->[BRIDGE]</s->
Am     Em        G       D        F
  They say all's fair in love and war
                E                     F                      G
  But I won't need to fight it, we'll get it right and we'll be united

Em             F#m                   G  A

  Than I get, than I get, than I get

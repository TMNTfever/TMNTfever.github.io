[VERSE 1]
              F           Am7       Dm7
  I know your eyes in the morning sun
  D7           Gm7           Am7       C7
  I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
           F              Am7      Dm7
  And the moment that you wander far from me
          Gm7                     C7
  I wanna feel you in my arms again

[REFRAIN 1]
            BbM7            Am7
  When you come to me on a summer breeze
           Gm7                         Eb7
  Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
           Am7               C7
  And it's me you need to show, how deep is your love

[CHORUS 1]
      F                       Am7/F        F7
  How deep is your love, how deep is your love
  BbM7                  Bbm6
  I really need to learn, cause we're
  F                       Eb              D7
  Living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                               Gm7
  When they all should let us be
       Bbm6             F
  We belong to you and me

[VERSE 2]
      Am7        Dm7
  I believe in you
  D7              Gm7     Am7     C7
  You know the door to my very soul
              F          Am7        Dm7
  You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
             Gm7            C7
  You're my savior when I fall

[REFRAIN 2]
            BbM7                 Am7
  And you may not think that I care for you
              Gm7                     Eb7
  When you know down inside that I really do
            Am7               C7
  When it's me you need to show, how deep is your love

  How deep is your love, how deep is your love
  BbM7                  Bbm6
  I really need to learn, cause we're
  F                       Eb              D7
  Living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                               Gm7
  When they all should let us be
       Bbm6             F

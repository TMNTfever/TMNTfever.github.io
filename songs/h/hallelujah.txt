[VERSE 1]
           C                 Am
  Now I've heard there was a secret chord
       C                    Am
  That David played, and it pleased the Lord
      F                G               C     G
  But you don't really care for music, do ya
     C                  F           G
  It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
      Am              F
  The minor fall, the major lift
      G               E7          Am
  The baffled king composing Hallelujah, oh
       F           Am          F           C  G C  G
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah

[VERSE 2]
       C                         Am
  Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
      C               Am
  You saw her bathing on the roof
      F              G             C        G
  Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
      C             F       G
  She tied you to a kitchen chair
      Am                         F
  She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
      G                  E7            Am
  And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah, oh
       F           Am          F           C  G C  G
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah

[VERSE 3]
       C              Am
  Well baby I've been here before
    C                       Am
  I know this room and I've walked this floor
    F             G             C      G
  I used to live alone before I knew ya
       C                     F      G
  I've seen your flag on the marble arch
  Am               F
  Love is not some victory march
         G               E7         Am
  It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah, oh
       F           Am          F           C  G
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah
       F           Am          F           C  G
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u
       C
  Hallelujah

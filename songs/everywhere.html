  Can you hear me callin out your name
C                   G            Am                  F
  You know that I'm fallin and I don't know what to say
C                     G      C            G
  I'll speak a little louder, I'll even shout
C                   G                 Am              F

  My friends think I'm acting peculiarly oh
  C            G C                      G
  Come one baby, you better make this start

  You better make it soon before you break my heart

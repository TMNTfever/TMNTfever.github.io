[VERSE 1]
  A                       A                     Bm7     C#m7
  Island grooves, we were in the right mood and driving
  A                    A                          Bm7    C#m7
  Windows down rolling through the hometown, just vibing
  A                           A
  Sun is going down and we’re rolling one up
          Bm7                     C#m
  I gotta gleam in my eye and got nothing but love
  A                      A                   Bm7  C#m
  Island grooves, we had nothing to lose, oh no

[PRE-CHORUS 1]
              A                 A           Bm7               C#m7
  Oh, we were young and we were bold, never doing what you’re told
        A                   A            Bm7                    C#m7
  We forget about the bad times, and reminisce about the good times

[CHORUS 1]
  A                           A                 Bm7  C#m7
  Let’s take it back, take it back down Guava Lane
  A                         A                     Bm7  C#m7
  Sitting in the bed of a truck in the pouring rain
      A                                 A
  The boys have got the bottles and the girls have got the green
  Bm7                             C#m7
  We were feeling good and living life just like a dream
  A                           A                 Bm7  C#m7
  Let’s take it back, take it back down Guava Lane
               A  E  A  E
  Whoa whoa whoa

             A                       A                    Bm7   C#m7
  I'm in the cool night air, and I’m listening to Gregory Isaac
           A                           A                       Bm7     C#m7
  Said I’m chilling right there with a spliff in my hand, just styling
  A                         A
  We were at the party everybody having fun
  Bm7                         C#m7
  Blue lights flashing and we started to run
  A                          A                 Bm7  C#m7
  That’s when we go, when we go back to Guava Lane

[BRIDGE]
          Bm7                                     C#m7
  So many times you, so wrapped up in what you’re tied to
                               Bm7                                  C#m7
  Get caught up in what you’re trying to do, time keeps slipping away
  D                                     E
  Feeling out of touch, go back in your mind it don’t take much
          D                                             E
  Don’t deny what you feel, you’ll find what is real inside

  Sitting in the bed of a truck in the pouring rain
      A                                 A
  The boys have got the bottles and the girls have got the green
  Bm7           C#m7
  Feeling good, living a dream
  A                           A                    Bm7
  Let’s take it back, take it back, let’s take it back

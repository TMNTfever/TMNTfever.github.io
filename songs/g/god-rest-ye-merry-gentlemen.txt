[VERSE 1]
      Em              D              C              B7
  God rest you merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
      Em               D           C              B7
  For Jesus Christ our Saviour was born upon this day
     Am               G                  Em              D
  To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

[CHORUS] (Repeat after every verse)
    G          B7          Em               D
  O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
    G          B7          Em
  O tidings of comfort and joy

[VERSE 2]
       Em               D        C             B7
  From God our heavenly father a blessed angel came
      Em           D                 C              B7
  And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
      Am            G                Em            D
  How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name

[VERSE 3]
      Em                 D         C              B7
  The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind
      Em                  D          C                  B7
  And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind
      Am            G                    Em              D
  And went to Bethlehem straightway this blessed Babe to find

[VERSE 4]
      Em            D                  C              B7
  But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this infant lay
       Em             D            C            B7
  They found him in a manger where oxen feed on hay
      Am          G          Em              D
  His mother Mary kneeling unto the lord did pray

[VERSE 5]
      Em               D            C               B7
  Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place
      Em                 D                C           B7
  And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace
       Am           G             Em           D
  This holy tide of Christmas all other doth deface

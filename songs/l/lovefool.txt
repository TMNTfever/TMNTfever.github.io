[VERSE 1]
  Am7               Dm7      FM7      G7             CM7      Am7*
  Dear I feel we're facing a problem, you love me no longer I know and
  Am7            Dm7          FM7      G7           C  Am7*
  Maybe there is nothing that I can do, to make you do
  Am7                Dm7         FM7    G7               CM7       Am7*     Am7
  Mama tells me that I shouldn't bother, said I ought to stick to another man
             Dm7      FM7      G7                C
  A man that surely deserves me, but I think you do

[REFRAIN 1]
C#o7   Dm    D#o7       E+7
  So I cry I pray and I beg you

[CHORUS 1]
  AM7              DM7
  Love me love me say that you love me
C#m7             Bm7        E7
  Fool me fool me go on and fool me
AM7                   DM7
  Love me love me pretend that you love me
C#m7               Bm7                E7
  Leave me leave me just say that you need me
AM7    DM7        C#m7        C#7     Cm7 E7
  So I cry, and I pray, and I beg for you to
  AM7              DM7
  Love me love me say that you love me
C#m7               Bm7           E7
  Leave me leave me say that you need me
  A       Dm         E+7
  I can't care 'bout anything but

[VERSE 2]
  Am7           Dm7         FM7       G7               CM7        Am7*
  Lately I have desperately pondered, spent my nights awake and I wonder
  Am7               Dm7      FM7      G7             C   Am7*
  What I could have done in another way, to make you stay
  Am7             Dm7       FM7     G7            CM7        Am7*
  Reason will not lead to solution, I will end up lost in confusion
  Am7             Dm7        FM7  G7                    C
  I don't care if you really care, as long as you don't go

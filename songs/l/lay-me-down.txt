[VERSE 1]
  CM7                                       -                                             Fa9
  Yes, I do, I believe, that one day I will be, where I was, right there, right next to you
                                                 -
  And it's hard, the days just seem so dark, the moon, the stars, are nothing without you
       CM7                                    -                                         Fa9
  Your touch, your skin, where do I begin, no words, can explain, the way I'm missing you
                                           -
  Deny, this emptiness this hole that I'm inside, these tears, they tell their own story

  You told me not to cry when you were gone, but the feelings overwhelming, it's much too strong
      C              Am7          Dm7  F/G      C                   Am7                     Dm7
  Can I lay by your side, next to you, you, and make sure you're alright, I'll take care of you
    F                        F/G                C
  I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[VERSE 2]
      CM7                                  Fa9

  This hurt that I've been through, I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

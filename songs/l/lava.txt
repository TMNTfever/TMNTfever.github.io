[VERSE 1]
C                      G7                  F                          C             G7
  A long long time ago, there was a volcano, living all alone, in the middle of the sea
C                           G7                            F                   C              G7
  He sat high above his bay, watching all the couples play, and wishing that, he had someone too
C                              G7                             F             C             G7
  And from his lava came, this song of hope that he sang, out-loud everyday for years and years

[CHORUS 1]
F                  C                         G7                      C
  I have a dream I hope will come true, that you're here with me and I'm here with you
    F                             C                  F       G7         C
  I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above, will send me someone to lava

[VERSE 2]
C                            G7                        F                     C              G7
  Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone, until he was on the brink of extinction
C                             G7                        F                  C                G7
  But little did he know that living in the sea below, another volcano was listening to his song

  C                            G7                         F                      C                  G7
  Every day she heard his tune. Her lava grew and grew, because she believed his song was meant for her
C                         G7                         F                        C            G7
  Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea, as he sang his song of hope for the last time

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1)
F                  C                         G7                      C
  I have a dream I hope will come true, that you're here with me and I'm here with you
    F                             C                  F       G7         C
  I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above, will send me someone to lava

[VERSE 3]
  C                         G7                    F                        C                 G7
  Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano, looking all around but she could not see him
     C                             G7                                F                C            G7
  He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone, but with no lava his song was all done
     C                                 G7                               F                       C             G7
  He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear, as she remembered what his song meant to her

[CHORUS 3] (Same as Chorus 1)
F                  C                         G7                      C
  I have a dream I hope will come true, that you're here with me and I'm here with you
    F                             C                  F       G7         C
  I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above, will send me someone to lava

[VERSE 4]
C                          G7                          F                      C             G7
  Oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea, all together now their lava grew and grew
  C                              G7                          F                    C                 G7
  No longer are they alone with Aloha as their new home, and when you visit them, this is what they sing

[CHORUS 4]
F                  C                         G7
  I have a dream I hope will come true, that you'll grow old with me
      C                          F                         C
  And I'll grow old with you, we thank the earth, sea, and sky we thank too

[OUTRO] x 3

  I  lava you

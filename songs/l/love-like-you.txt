  If I could begin to be, half of what you think of me

  Cause I think you’re so good, and I’m nothing like you
               Eb         Gm        Cm              Fm

  If I could begin to do, something that does right by you
          Eb       C                      Fm           Bo7
  I would do about anything, I would even learn how to love

  Love me like you, love like you

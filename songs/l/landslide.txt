  I took my love, I took it down
Eb             Bb                     Cm  Bb
  Climbed a mountain and I turned around
         Eb         Bb              Cm          Bb

  Till the landslide brought me down

  Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love
             Eb              Bb        Cm  Bb
  Can the child within my heart rise above
           Eb               Bb     Cm     Bb
  Can I sail through the changin' o-cean tides
          Eb         Bb      Cm   Bb
  Can I handle the seasons of my life

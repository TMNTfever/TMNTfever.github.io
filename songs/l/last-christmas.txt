  Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away
  Em                                    A
  This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[INTERLUDE 1]
  D  Bm  Em  A

[VERSE 1]
D                          Bm
  Once bitten and twice shy, I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Em                                A
  Tell me baby do you recognize me, well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
D                                               Bm
  "Merry Christmas!" I wrapped it up and sent it, with a note saying: "I love you!", I meant it
  Em                                           A
  Now I know what a fool I've been, but if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[VERSE 2]
D                                      Bm
  Crowded room, friends with tired eyes, hiding from you and your soul of ice
Em                                               A
  My God, I thought you were someone to rely on, me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
    D                                           Bm
  A face on a lover with a fire in his heart, a man undercover but you tore him apart
Em                                         A
  Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

  A face on a lover with a fire in his heart, a man undercover but you tore him apart
Em                      A                                             D
  Maybe next year, I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

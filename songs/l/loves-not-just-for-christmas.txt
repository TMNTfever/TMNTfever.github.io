[VERSE 1]
G                                       Bm7
  I filled your stocking to the very top, put your coffee in a Christmas cup
           Em                   D                      C   D
  And the children sing as the church bells ring everywhere
G                                    Bm7
  Everyone's about the peace on Earth, a little Christmassing for what it's worth

  And the whole world smiles, there′s only love in the air
   C6                Cm            D
  Snow fall faster, go get santa now

  Christmas - wrap it and send it, Christmas - however you spend it

G                                  B7
  I put a lot of tinsel on the tree, bought a turkey and some brandy cream
          Em           D                         C   D
  And my mistletoe is hanging in the hope of a kiss
   C6                Cm            D
  Snow fall faster, go get santa now

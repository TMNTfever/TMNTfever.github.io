G
  Stuck on you 
Bm7             C                       D7   
  I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
G            Bm7   C   D7
  Guess I'm on my way
G           Bm7
  Needed a friend
          C                      D7
  And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you 'til the end

Bm7           C                     D7                   G
  Been a fool too long I guess it's time for me to come on home 
G            Bm7   C   D7
  Guess I'm on my way 
G             Bm7
  So hard to see 
          C                          D7
  That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
G            Bm7   C

  And I know just where I'm going 
Em                    Bm7             C                 D7
  I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away 
         C              D7
  'Cause this time I'm leaving and 
      C               D7
  I'm coming home to stay

[VERSE 1]
                A      AM7          A7 
  Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
            D                     D#dim 
  Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
            A   D          A  AM7  F#m
  My baby's gone I have no friends
             B7             E     E+ 
  To wish me greetings once again



               A       Amaj7       A7 
Choirs will be singing     "Silent Night"
          D               D#dim  
Christmas carols by candlelight
                     A          D 
Please come home for Christmas
                     A         F#m 
Please come home for Christmas
           B7     E               A     A7 
If not for Christmas,   by New Year's night



               D                Dm 
Friends and relations, send salutations
A           E+           A    A7 
Sure as the stars shine above
            D                         Dm 
For this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
            B7                          E   Eaug 
The time of year to be with the one you love



             A      Amaj7                  A7 
So won't you tell me     you'll never more roam
              D                        D#dim 
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
                    A      C#              F#m D#dim 
There'll be no more sorrow,    no grief and pain
            A  F#   B    E      A    Eaug 
And I'll be happy, happy  once again


? A Amaj7 A7 ? D  D#dim ?


                          A     C#              F#m D#dim 
Oh oh there'll be no more sorrow,  no grief and pain
             A   F#      B /      E /        A  D  A
And I'll be happy,    at Christmas  once again

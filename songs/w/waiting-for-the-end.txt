[INTRO 1] x 4(piano plays E on and-of-1 into 2, and on and-of-3 into 4, drum on 2nd half)
  E

[INTRO 2]
  E                                                      E
  This is not the end, this is not the beginning, just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
          E                                                     E
  But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm, though the words sound steady, something's empty within'em

         E                                                 E
  We say yeah! With fists flying up in the air, like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
              E                                                      E
  Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear, until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[VERSE 1] (Piano keeps playing E with strings above: B C# A G#|F#, drum on 2nd half)
  E                                          A
  Waiting for the end to come, wishing I had strength to stand
                   F#m                             E   B
  This is not what I had planned, it's out of my control
  E                                                    A
  Flying at the speed of light, thoughts were spinning in my head
                      F#m                              E  B
  So many things were left unsaid, it's hard to let you go

[CHORUS 1] (Vocal "oh" bounces between C# and B)
C#m                        A      C#m                      A
  I know what it takes to move on, I know how it feels to lie
E                      B                               C#m                        A  E
  All I wanna do is trade this life for something new, holding onto what I haven't got

[VERSE 2] (wait for drum lead-in, sung with harmony, same piano and string as Verse 1)
  E                                      A
  Sitting in an empty room, trying to forget the past
                 F#m                            E  B
  This was never meant to last, I wish it wasn't so

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1)
C#m                        A      C#m                      A
  I know what it takes to move on, I know how it feels to lie
E                      B                               C#m                        A  E
  All I wanna do is trade this life for something new, holding onto what I haven't got

[BRIDGE]
E                                          E
  What was left when that fire was gone, I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
  E                                          E
  All caught up in the eye of the storm, and trying to figure out what it’s like moving on

      E                                                E
  And I don’t even know what kind of things I said, my mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
         E                                                E
  So I'm picking up those pieces, now where to begin, the hardest part of ending is starting again

[INTERLUDE]
  E  C#m  B
  -------- Ohhh

[CHORUS 3] (Interweave Intro 2 starting on 2nd line)
E                      B                               C#m                         A  (E)
  All I wanna do is trade this life for something new, holding on to what I haven't got
E    E       C#m                        B  E
  Oh-oh, I'm holding onto what I haven't got
E C#m                        B  -
  Holding onto what I haven't got

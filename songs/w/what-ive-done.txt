[VERSE 1]
              Em                G                 D
  In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi
Am                    Em              G           D
  Cause I’ve drawn regret, from the truth of a thousand lies
Am             C              D
  So let mercy come and wash away

[CHORUS 1]
            Em         G          D             Am          Em
  What I’ve done, I'll face myself to cross out what I’ve become
   G          D              Am        Em
  Erase myself and let go of what I’ve done

[VERSE 2]
           G             D
  Put to rest what you thought of me
Am                   Em               G           D
  While I clean this slate, with the hands of uncertainty
Am             C              D
  So let mercy come and wash away

[CHORUS 2]
            Em         G          D             Am          Em
  What I’ve done, I'll face myself to cross out what I’ve become
   G          D              Am   Am   Em  G  D  Am
  Erase myself and let go of what I’ve done

[INTERLUDE] (Bass A-minor climb)
  Em  G  D  Am

[BRIDGE]
                Em         G
  For what I’ve done, I’ll start again
D          Am       Em      G
  Whatever pain may come, today this ends
D           Am   Am   Em
  Forgiving what I’ve done

[CHORUS 3]
       G          D             Am          Em
  I'll face myself to cross out what I’ve become
   G          D              Am        Em  G  D
  Erase myself and let go of what I’ve done

      Am        Em  G  D
  For what I've done
            Am        Em  G  D  Am
  Forgiving what I've done

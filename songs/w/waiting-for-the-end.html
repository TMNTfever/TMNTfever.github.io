<div><s->[INTRO 1]</s-> <l->(piano plays E on and-of-1 into 2, and on and-of-3 into 4, drum on 2nd half)</l->
<c->  E x4</c->

<s->[INTRO 2]</s-> <l->(all in E, sung in harmony)</l->
<l->  This is not the end, this is not the beginning, just a voice like a riot rocking every revision</l->
<l->  But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm, though the words sound steady, something's empty within'em</l->

<l->  We say yeah! With fists flying up in the air, like we're holding onto something that's invisible there</l->
<l->  Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear, until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear</l->

<s->[VERSE 1]</s-> <l->(piano keeps playing E with strings above: B C# A G#|F#, drum on 2nd half)</l->
<c->  E                                          A</c->
<l->  Waiting for the end to come, wishing I had strength to stand</l->
<c->                   F#m                             E   B</c->
<l->  This is not what I had planned, it's out of my control</l->
<c->  E                                                    A</c->
<l->  Flying at the speed of light, thoughts were spinning in my head</l->
<c->                      F#m                              E  B</c->
<l->  So many things were left unsaid, it's hard to let you go</l->

<div class="focus"><r->[CHORUS 1]</r-> <l->(vocal "oh" bounces between C# and B)</l->
<c->C#m                        A      C#m                      A</c->
<l->  I know what it takes to move on, I know how it feels to lie</l->
<c->E                      B                               C#m                        A  E</c->
<l->  All I wanna do is trade this life for something new, holding onto what I haven't got</l->
</div>
<div><s->[VERSE 2]</s-> (wait for drum lead-in, sung with harmony, same piano and string as Verse 1)
<c->- E                                      A</c->
<l->  Sitting in an empty room, trying to forget the past</l->
<c->                 F#m                            E  B</c->
<l->  This was never meant to last, I wish it wasn't so</l->

<r->[CHORUS 2]</r->
<l->  (Same as Chorus 1)</l->

<b->[BRIDGE]</b-> <l->(all in E, sung with harmony, played with distortion)</l->
<l->  What was left when that fire was gone, I thought it felt right but that right was wrong</l->
<l->  All caught up in the eye of the storm, and trying to figure out what it’s like moving on</l->

<l->  And I don’t even know what kind of things I said, my mouth kept moving and my mind went dead</l->
<l->  So picking up those pieces now where to begin, the hardest part of ending is starting again</l->

<b->[INTERLUDE]</b->
<c->  E  C#m  B</c->
<l->  -------- Ohhh</l->

  I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier

  Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber

  Taking Molly with me, but I never knew the danger
       F                              Dm
  For about six or maybe seven, yeah in walked Captain Farrell
  A#                                   F

  Now some men like the fishing, and some men like the fowling
A#                              F
  And some men like to hear, to hear the cannonball a-roaring
  F                     Dm
  Me I like sleeping, especially in my Molly's chamber
A#                                F

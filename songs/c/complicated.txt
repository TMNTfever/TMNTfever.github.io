[INTRO] x 4
  F#m  D  A  E

[VERSE 1]
A                               F#m
  Chill out, whatcha yellin' for, lay back, it's all been done before
D                       E
  And if you could only let it be, you would see
A                           F#m
  I like you the way you are, when we're drivin' in your car
D                          E
  And you're talkin' to me one-on-one, but you become

[REFRAIN 1]
  D                                          F#m
  Somebody else 'round everyone else, you're watchin' your back like you can't relax
         D                                           E
  You're tryin' to be cool, you look like a fool to me - tell me

[CHORUS 1]
  F#m                           D                A       E
  Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated, I see the way you're
  F#m                           D                 A     E
  Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated, life's like this, you
F#m                        D                           A                           E
  And you fall, and you crawl, and you break, and you take what you get, and you turn it into
  Bm                                                 D             A
  Honesty, and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it, no no no

[VERSE 2]
A                          F#m
  You come over unannounced, dressed up like you're somethin' else
D                              E
  Where you are and where it's at, you see, you're makin' me
A                                    F#m
  Laugh out when you strike your pose, take off all your preppy clothes
D                              E
  You know, you're not foolin' anyone when you become

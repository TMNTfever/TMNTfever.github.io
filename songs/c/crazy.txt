  F#m

[VERSE 1]
F#m                                                        A
  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                               D
  There was something so pleasant about that place
                                               C#s4  C#
  Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
F#m                                                           A
  And when you're out there without care, yeah I was out of touch
                                         D                     C#s4  C#
  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough, I just knew to much

[CHORUS 1]
                      F#m                      A                        D           C#s4  C#
  Does that make me crazy, does that make me crazy, does that make me crazy, possibly

[VERSE 2]
F#m                                                 D
  And I hope that you are having the time of your life
              A                       C#s4  C#
  But think twice, that's my only advice
F#m                                                                      A
  Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are
                        D                                   C#s4  C#
  Ha ha ha bless your soul, you really think you're in control

[CHORUS 2]
                   F#m                   A                     D               C#s4  C#
  I think you're crazy, I think you're crazy, I think you're crazy, just like me

[VERSE 3]
F#m                                                       D
  My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
              A                                      C#s4  C#
  And all I remember is thinking, I wanna be like them
F#m                                                                 A
  Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
                                 D                          C#s4    C#
  And it's no coincidence I've come, and I can die when I'm done

[CHORUS 3] x 3 (2nd pass done in half-time)
                  F#m                 A                  D           C#s4  C#
  But maybe I'm crazy, maybe you're crazy, maybe we're crazy, probably

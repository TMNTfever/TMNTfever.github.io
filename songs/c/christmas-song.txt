[INTRO]
  CM7  Dm7  Em7 Dm7 (x2)

[VERSE 1]
CM7         Dm7            Em7         Dm7
  Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
CM7          Gm              F      Fm
  Jack Frost nipping at your nose
CM7        Dm7          Em7       B7
  Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
      E             Fm4         G     G7
  And folks dressed up like Eskimos

[VERSE 2]
            CM7     Dm7             Em7         Dm7
  Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
CM7       Gm       F         Fm
  Help to make the season bright
CM7    Dm7             Em7        B7
  Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
               Dm7 F           CM7     C7
  Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[BRIDGE]
                 Gm C7           Gm    C7
  They know that San-ta's on his way
              Gm               C7             Dm7
  He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
F            Fm            A#        D#    A#
  And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
            A7              E7          A7    G7
  To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[VERSE 3]
      CM7    Dm7           Em7             Dm7
  And so I'm offering this simple phrase
     CM7       Gm            F     Fm
  To kids from one to ninety-two
    CM7              Dm7        Em7         B7
  Although it's been said, many times, many ways
        F        G   CM7   Dm7 Em7 Dm7
  Merry Christmas to you
        F        G   CM7   Em7 C CM7
  Merry Christmas to you

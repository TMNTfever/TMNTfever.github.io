[VERSE 1]
D                                  G
  When there's music inside of you, someday you know that it's gotta come through
A                                          A/B                D
  That's why we're here, we're telling you true, we're coming out of our shells

[VERSE 2]
D                                                   G
  You hear the rhythm and you're moving you're feet, ain't nothing like a song with a beat, no
A                                    A/B                  D
  We're coming out up from under the street, we're coming out of our shells

  Once we got started we knew that we scored, learning the music and finding the chords
G                             GM7                       Em7                       D5
  We just kept practicing, we stayed underground, cause singing in the sewer is a wonderful sound

[CHORUS 1]
  D*                 DM7              D6
  Out of our shells, whoa oh whoa oh, out of our shells
Bm7                               A
  You know, you know we're coming out of our shells

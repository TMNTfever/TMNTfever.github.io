[VERSE 1]
                 A                             F#m
  Used to seeing black and white, never really in between
                 D                        E
  Waiting on the love of my life, to come into my dreams
               A                          F#m
  Everything is shades of gray, never any blues or green

  Needed someone else to turn to, someone who could help me learn to see
          D                 E
  All the beauty that was waiting for me

[CHORUS 1]
  A                                    F#m
  You, you put the blue back in the sky, you put the rainbow in my eyes
Bm                           D                    E
  A silver lining in my prayers and now, there's color everywhere
F#m                               E
  You put the red back in the rose, just when I needed it the most
B                              D                    E
  You came along to show you care and now, there's color everywhere

[VERSE 2]
A  E                           A                   F#m
  Everywhere, my life is so predictable, never any mystery
                     D                                 E
  But ever since you shined the light, all of that was history
               A                          F#m
  Now I have a hand to hold, and a reason to believe

  Someone in my life worth living for, I was hanging around just wishing on a star
             D               E
  To put the happiness back into my heart

[CHORUS 2]

  A silver lining in my prayers and now, there's color everywhere

[BRIDGE]
D*           C#m7           Bm7   E                D*
  Left those hazy days behind me, never to return again
              Bm7            E
  Now they're just a faded memory
        F#6                                                            (B)

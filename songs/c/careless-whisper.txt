[VERSE 1]
  Dm             Gm7     Bb                          A7     C
  I feel so unsure, as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
Dm                  Gm7
  As the music dies, something in your eyes
  Bb                                 A7      C       (Dm)
  Calls to mind a silver screen, and all its sad goodbyes

[CHORUS 1]
Dm                             Gm7
  I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Bb                               A7                  C
  Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
  Dm
  Should have known better than to cheat a friend
      Gm7
  And waste the chance that I've been given
Bb                                    A                 C
  So I'm never gonna dance again, the way I danced with you

[VERSE 2]
  Dm                Gm7    Bb                A7   C
  Time can never mend, the careless whispers of a good friend
Dm                      Gm7
  To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
  Bb                               A       C            (Dm)
  Thereâ€™s no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

  Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
  Dm
  Should have known better than to cheat a friend
      Gm7
  And waste the chance that I've been given
Bb                                    A                 C
  So I'm never gonna dance again, the way I danced with you

[BRIDGE]
    Dm                               Gm7
  Tonight the music seems so loud, I wish that we could lose this crowd
  Bb                               A7                                 C
  Maybe it's better this way, we'd hurt each other with the things we wanna say
     Dm                                   Gm7
  We could have been so good together, we could have lived this dance forever
      Bb                          A7 C
  But now who's gonna dance with me, please stay

Dm                           Gm7                       Bb
  (Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
                    A7       C
  That you had to leave me alone
Dm              Gm7            Bb            A7 C
  B'da-da da-da, b'da-da da-da, b'da-da da-da

[VERSE 1]
                        D                              F#
  When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eyes
                       G                         Gm
  You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
                    D                      F#
  You float like a feather in a beautiful world
                 G                          Gm
  I wish I was special, you're so fucking special

[CHORUS 1]
               D            F#
  But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                            G                Gm
  What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

[VERSE 2]
                       D                      F#
  I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
                    G                      Gm
  I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
                 D                    F#
  I want you to notice when I'm not around
                      G                     Gm
  You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1)
               D            F#
  But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                            G                Gm
  What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

[BRIDGE]
              D                      F#
  Oooh, oooh, she's running out the door
  G                      Gm             D F# G Gm
  She's running out, she run, run, run, run, run

[VERSE 3]
                      D                   F#
  Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
                      G                     Gm
  You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

[CHORUS 3] (Same as Chorus 1)
               D            F#
  But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                            G                Gm
  What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
                 A                             F#m
  Used to seeing black and white, never really in between
                 D                        E
  Waiting on the love of my life, to come into my dreams
               A                          F#m
  Everything is shades of gray, never any blues or green
Bm7                              C#m7                                 F#m
  Needed someone else to turn to, someone who could help me learn to see
          E
  All the beauty that was waiting for me

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
  A                                     F#m
  You, you put the blue back in the sky, you put the rainbow in my eyes
Bm                           D                    E
  A silver lining in my prayers and now, there's color everywhere
F#m                                E
  You put the red back in the rose, just when I needed it the most
B                              D                    E            A
  You came along to show you care and now, there's color everywhere

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
                  A                    F#m
  My life is so predictable, never any mystery
                     D                                 E
  But ever since you shined the light, all of that was history
               A                          F#m
  Now I have a hand to hold, and a reason to believe
Bm7                               C#m7                                    F#m
  Someone in my life worth living for, I was hanging around just wishing on a star
             E
  To put the happiness back in my heart

Bm                           D                   E

<s->[BRIDGE]</s->
D            A              Bm    A                D
  Left those hazy days behind me, never to return again
              Bm             F#m
  Now they're just a faded memory
        F#                                 F#7                          B

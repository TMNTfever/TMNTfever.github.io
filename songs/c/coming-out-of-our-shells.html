  When there's music inside of you, someday you know that it's gotta come through
A                                          A/B                D
  That's why we're here, we're telling you true, we're coming out of our shells

  You hear the rhythm and you're moving you're feet, ain't nothing like a song with a beat, no

  Once we got started we knew that we scored, learning the music and finding the chords

  We just kept practicing, we stayed underground, cause singing in the sewer is a wonderful sound

[VERSE 1]
          AM7 DM7           AM7                   DM7
  I was lonely, I needed someone to see me through
             AM7              DM7              AM7               DM7
  And I was at the end of my rope, I needed someone to cut me loose
               Bm7                 E               Bm7                           E
  And then an angel, out of the blue, gave me the sense that I might make it through
      E/D          C#m7                      F#m7
  And somehow I survived, with no rhyme or reason
      GM7                                  D
  And now I know I'll make it, through the miracle of you

[CHORUS 1]
A            C#m7       D          D
  I know the color of love, and it lives inside of you
A            C#m7       D                D
  I know the color of truth, it's in the image of you
        Bm7            F#m7            E              F#7

          Bm7        C#7             F#m7               B7
  It will color your soul, like a rainbow (like a rain--bow)
          D        E               AM7
  And the color of love is in you (colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of)

  You stood beside me, stood beside me, and your love, did not falter
                Bm7              E              Bm7                                  E
  And then the angel, angel in you, gave me the strength to know that I will get through
      E/D            C#m7                     F#m7
  And that's how I survived, ain't no other reason

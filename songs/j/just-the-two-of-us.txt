DM7            C#7            F#m7             Em7| Aa9    DM7
  I see the crystal raindrops fall, and the beauty of it all
                C#7             F#m7
  Is when the sun comes shining through
DM7                C#7         F#m7            Em7  |  Aa9     DM7
  To make those rainbows in my mind, when I think of you sometime
                 C#7               F#m7
  And I wanna spend some time with you

  Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, just the two of us, just the two of us
           DM7      C#7          F#m7   Fm7     Em7|Aa9      DM7      C#7        F#m7
  Just the two of us, building castles in the sky,  just the two of us, you and I

DM7             C#7             F#m7          Em7      Aa9      DM7
  We look for love, no time for tears, wasted water's all that is
                 C#7           F#m7
  And it don't make no flowers grow
DM7                 C#7               F#m7                 Em7    Aa9      DM7
  Good things might come to those who wait, but not for those who wait too late
            C#7          F#m7
  We gotta go for all we know

  Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, just the two of us, just the two of us

  Just the two of us, building castles in the sky,  just the two of us, you and I

DM7             C#7            F#m7           Em7    Aa9       DM7
  I hear the crystal raindrops fall, on the window down the hall
             C#7             F#m7
  And it becomes the morning dew
DM7            C#7              F#m7           Em7     Aa9     DM7
  And darling, when the morning comes, and I see the morning sun
           C#7            F#m7
  I wanna be the one with you

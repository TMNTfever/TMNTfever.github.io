<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
      C                           Em
  And now that we've reached the end
             F
  I think of all that's passed
             Fm6
  Of how the time that went so fast
         C                   Em
  And of how I've come to depend
           F                                G  G#o7
  Upon the faith I feel inside your guiding hands


<span>[REFRAIN 1]</span>
Am            AmM7
  Say you'll go with me forever
           GM7
  Though I know that you can't
         Am
  Well I ain't much with words
                          AmM7
  There's nothin' I could say that you ain't heard
        F                               G
  But I promise you that each and every day


<span>[CHORUS 1]</span>
C                 Am
  I'll hear your voice
            F                             G
  In every thought that flows through my mind
C                Am
  I'll see your face
            F                            G  G#o7
  In every cloud that floats through my sky
  Am                         AmM7
  And when the world is too much
                         C                   Fm6  G#o7
  And the hurt's got me down on my knees to pray
C                 Am
  I'll hear your voice
                 F    G    C
  And you won't be so far away


<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
           C                  Em
  Do you remember a moonless night
            F
  With only sound for a view
                Fm6
  Funny what an ocean can do
         C                          Em
  It was then that we knew this was right
             F                               G  G#o7
  And in our arms we would've shared so many nights


<span>[REFRAIN 2]</span>
Am            AmM7
  Say you'll go with me wherever
                GM7
  Even though I know it's just a dream
           Am
  Though I know it's unknown
                        AmM7
  It's something that I gotta do alone
        F
  But I swear to you I could never do
     G
  Anything without your soul inside


<span>[CHORUS 2]</span>
C                 Am
  I'll hear your voice
            F                             G
  In every thought that flows through my mind
C                Am
  I'll see your face
            F                            G  G#o7
  In every cloud that floats through my sky
  Am                         AmM7
  And when the world is too much
                         C                   Fm6  G#o7
  And the hurt's got me down on my knees to pray
C                 Am
  I'll hear your voice
                 F    G    C
  And you won't be so far away


<span>[BRIDGE]</span>
               A#                       Am7
  Someday I'll hold you, and we will be sailin'
             G#                          G
  And I will never have to say goodbye again

  Til then, til that day
C
  I'll hear your

  I'll see your face
            G                            A  A#o7
  In every cloud that floats through my sky
  Bm                         BmM7
  And when the world is too much
                         D                   Gm6  A#o7
  And the hurt's got me down on my knees to pray
D                 Bm

  There are those, I am sure, who have told you
             Dm           C#+         FM7  F#o7
  They would give you the world for a toy
        Em             D#+       GM7       Bm6
  All I have are these arms to enfold you

  And the love time can never destroy

  If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
            CM7               C#o7           A7sus  A7
  You'll be glad to know that my demands are small

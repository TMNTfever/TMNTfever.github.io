  So I'll sing you to sleep, after the lovin'

  With a song that I wrote just yesterday
        Dm            C#+
  And I hope you can hear
           G             G7            CM7  G7

  Its so hard, to explain, everything that I feeling
          Dm     C#+             Dm7  Dm6
  Face to face, I just seem to go dry
        Dm           C#+
  But I love you so much
           G             G7                CM7  G7
  That the sound of your voice can make me high

  Thanks for taking me, on a way trip to the sun
Am               AmM7     Am7  Am6n5
  And thanks for turning me
       Dm  G/3       F   G7
  Into someone, into someone

          C            CM7   C6        CM7
  So I'll sing you to sleep, after the lovin'
         Dm          C#+              Dm7  Dm6
  With a song that I wrote just yesterday
        Dm            C#+
  And I hope you can hear
           G             G7            CM7  G7
  What the words and the music has to say


<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
         C          CM7         C6           CM7
  Its so hard, to explain, everything that I feeling
          Dm     C#+             Dm7  Dm6
  Face to face, I just seem to go dry
        Dm           C#+
  But I love you so much
           G             G7                CM7  G7
  That the sound of your voice can make me high


<span>[BRIDGE 1]</span>
F                    Em      Dm   G7         C  C7
  Thanks for taking me, on a way trip to the sun
Am               AmM7     Am7  Am6n5
  And thanks for turning me
       Dm  G/3       F   G7
  Into someone, into someone


<span>[VERSE 3]</span>

  And I brush back the hair from your eyes
          Dm            C#+
  And the love on your face
        G            G7          A  A7  As4  A
  Is so real that it makes wanna cry 


<span>[CHORUS 1]</span>

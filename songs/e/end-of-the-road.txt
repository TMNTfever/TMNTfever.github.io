[VERSE 1]
C             Cs4 C G/A                     Am7 G F
  We belong together, and you know that I'm right
             Em7                       F/D                 F/G
  Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind
C                 Cs4 C G/A                 Am7 G F
  Said we'd be forever,  said it'd never die
                Em7                        F/D           F/G
  How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

[PRE-CHORUS 1]
         Am                           AmM7
  Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
       Am7                    F#m7b5
  Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
  FM7                    Em7             Dm7       Em7        F/G
  Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead, spinnin' around and around

                 C           Dm7 C      G/A           Am7   G/E Fs2
  Although we've come to the end of the road, still I can't let go
         C/E            F/D             F/G
  It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
  C           Dm7 C      G/A           Am7   G/E Fs2
  Come to the end of the road, still I can't let go

               Em7                     F/D             F/G
  You've never been there before, it's only your first time
C               Cs4     C    G/A               Am7 G F
  Maybe I'll forgive you, hmmm, maybe you'll try
              Em7                F/D           F/G
  We should be happy together forever, you and I

  This time I want you to love me much more
  FM7                     Em7                 Dm7       Em7          F/G

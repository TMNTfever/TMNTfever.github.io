[VERSE 1]
C                 G     C          G
  Can you hear me callin out your name
C                   G            Am                  F
  You know that I'm fallin and I don't know what to say
C                     G      C            G
  I'll speak a little louder, I'll even shout
C                   G                 Am              F
  You know that I'm proud and I can't get the words out

  Somethings happening, happening to me
C                      G             Am  F
  My friends think I'm acting peculiarly, oh
C         G         C                   G
  Come on baby, you better make this start
C                    G               Am           F
  You better make it soon before you break my heart

  Oh I-------I-I wanna be with you everywhere

C             Cs4 C G/6                     Am7 G F
  We belong together, and you know that I'm right
             Em7                       F/2                 F/2/5
  Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind
C                 Cs4 C G/6                 Am7 G F
  Said we'd be forever,  said it'd never die
                Em7                        F/2           F/2/5
  How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

         Am                           E/5#
  Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
       C/5                    F#m7b5
  Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
  FM7                    Em7             Dm7       Em7        F/5
  Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead, spinnin' around and around

  Although we've come to the end of the road, still I can't let go
         C/3            F/2             F/5
  It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
  C           Dm7 C      G/6           Am7   G/3 Fs2
  Come to the end of the road, still I can't let go

  See girl I know you really love me, you just don't realize
               Em7                     F/2             F/5
  You've never been there before, it's only your first time
C               Cs4     C    G/6               Am7 G F
  Maybe I'll forgive you, hmmm, maybe you'll try
              Em7                F/2           F/5
  We should be happy together forever, you and I

<s->[PRE-CHORUS 2]</s->

  Can you love me again like you loved me before
  C/5                     F#m7b5
  This time I want you to love me much more
  FM7                     Em7                 Dm7       Em7          F/5

[VERSE 1]
                D                      E
  You're a falling star, you're the getaway car
              G          A              D
  You're the line in the sand when I go too far
                   D                E
  You're the swimming pool, on an August day
                 G       A          D
  And you're the perfect thing to say

               D                   E
  And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute
               G               A            D
  Ah, when you smile at me you know exactly what you do
             D                       E
  Baby don't pretend, that you don't know it's true
                G             A       D
  Cause you can see it when I look at you

[CHORUS 1]

  And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
       D7         G       F#      Bm7
  It's you, it's you, you make me sing
                E                   Gm              D
  You're every line, you're every word, you're everything

[VERSE 2]
             D                  E
  You're a carousel, you're a wishing well
                G     A              D
  And you light me up, when you ring my bell
              D                   E
  You're a mystery, you're from outerspace
               G            A    D
  You're every minute of my everyday

              D                    E
  And I can't believe, uh that I'm your man
        G               A           D
  And I get to kiss you baby just because I can
           D                       E
  Whatever comes our way, ah we'll see it through
              G                A        D
  And you know that's what our love can do

 Hey baby, won't you look my way?
      G
I can be your new addiction
D
 Hey baby, what you gotta say?
           G
All you're giving me is fiction
D                            G
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
A
I found out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks
 
<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
                  D
It started with a whisper
                    G
And that was when I kissed her
                      A       G
And then she made my lips hurt
                 D
I could hear the chit chat
                F#
Take me to your love shack
                    G       A
Mama's always gotta backtrack
               D
When everybody talks back
 
<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
D
 Hey honey, you could be my drug
          G
You could be my new prescription
D
 Too much could be an overdose
         G
All this trash talk make me itchin'
A
Oh my mouth, yeah, everybody talks, everybody talks
           N.C.
Everybody talks, too much

Never thought I'd live
            D
To see the day
     G                             A
When everybody's words got in the way

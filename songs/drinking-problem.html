[Intro]
G#m C# F# D#m
 
[Verse 1]
           G#m
One more night
          C#
One more down
          F#           D#m
One more, one more round
           G#m
First one in
           C#
Last one out
             F#                   D#m
Givin' this town lots to talk about
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
              G#m
They don't know
                    C#
What they don't know
 
[Chorus]
                       G#m
People say I got a drinkin' problem
                          F#
That ain't no reason to stop
                         G#m
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
                               C#
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
                          B
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
                                A#m
So pull another bottle off the wall
                      G#m
People say I got a drinkin' problem,
         C#
But I got no problem drinking at all
 
[Post-Chorus]
F#
They keep on talkin'
D#m
Drawin' conclusions
G#m
They call it a problem
C#
I call it a solution
 
[Interlude]
F# D#m G#m C#
 
[Verse 2]
            G#m             C#
Last call gets later and later
            F#                     D#m
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
           G#m
Same ole folks
           C#
Same ole songs
            F#            D#m
Same ole, same ole blue neon
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
              G#m
The same ole buzz
            C#
Just because
 
[Chorus]
                          G#m
People say I've got a drinkin' problem
                          F#
That ain't no reason to stop
                         G#m
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
                               C#
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
                          B
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
                                A#m
So pull another bottle off the wall
                         G#m
People say I've got a drinkin' problem,
         C#
But I got no problem drinking at all
 
[Post-Chorus]
F#
They keep on talkin'
D#m
Drawin' conclusions
G#m
They call it a problem
C#
I call it a solution
F#                          D#m
Just sittin' here in all my grand illusions
G#m                        C#
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
 
[Solo]
G#m F# G#m C#
 
[Chorus]
                          B
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
                                A#m
So pull another bottle off the wall
                      G#m

[Post-Chorus]
F#
They keep on talkin'
D#m

I call it a solution
F#                          D#m
Just sittin' here in all my grand illusions
G#m                        C#
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

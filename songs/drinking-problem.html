[INTRO]
  Bb  Gm  Cm  F


[VERSE 1]
            Cm              F
  One more night, one more down
             Bb       Gm
  One more, one more round
             Cm          F
  First one in, ast one out
               Bb                     Gm
  Givin' this town lots to talk about
                Cm                 F
  They don't know what they don't know
   

[CHORUS 1]
                      Cm              F
  People say I got a drinkin' problem
                            Bb  Gm
  That ain't no reason to stop
                           Cm             F        
  People saying that I've hit rock bottom
                                 Bb  Gm
  Just cause I'm living on the rocks
                         Cm              F
  It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
                                  Bb  Gm
  So pull another bottle off the wall
                      Cm
  People say I got a drinkin' problem,
           F
  But I got no problem drinking at all
   

[REFRAIN 1]
Bb
  They keep on talkin'
   Gm
  Drawin' conclusions
        Cm
  They call it a problem
     F               Bb
  I call it a solution
   

[VERSE 2]
             Cm             F
  Last call gets later and later
             Bb                      Gm
  I come in here so I don't have to hate her
            Cm              F
  Same ole folks, same ole songs
                  Bb           Gm
  Same ole, same ole blue neon
                Cm          F
  The same ole buzz just because

Bb                          Gm
  Just sittin' here in all my grand illusions
        Cm                   F                 Bb
  They call it a problem, I call it a solution

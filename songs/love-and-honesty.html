<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
  G           G7
  Brown skin, light brown eyes
  Em               Em7
  Golden hair from sunny skies
    Am                 Am7          D
  A haunting smile, a fresh pikake lei
  G             G7
  Soft touch, a warm embrace
  Em                    Em7
  Tears of joy they run down my face
    Am            Am7          D  D7
  I think of you every single day

  My love for you really made me see
    C                    Cmaj7
  I won`t give up, won`t lose my dreams

<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
  G       G7
  Sunset, moonrise
  Em                 Em7
  Calming seas under balmy skies
    Am                Am7                   D
  A walk with you beneath the whispering trees
     G                    G7
  We laughed so much our throats were dry
   Em                Em7
  Shared our hearts, teary-eyed
  Am7                                 D  D7
  Let this night remind us there`s a way

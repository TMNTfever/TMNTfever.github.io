[Intro]
Dm  Em  F   Am7 G 3x
C
 
 
[Verse]
      Dm      Em      F  Am7 G
There must be some mis un der standing
      Dm      Em  F    Am7   G
There must be some kind of mistake
  Dm     Em    F    Am7 G
I waited in the rain for hours
             C
And you were late
 
         Dm       Em   F   Am7 G
Now it's not like me to say the right thing
        Dm       Em       F   Am7 G
But you could've called to let me know
  Dm           Em    F      Am7   G
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
          C
So I went home
 
Ab               Bb      AbM7           Bb   
   Well I'd been waiting       for this weekend
Ab                Bb             AbM7   Bb   
   I thought that maybe we could see a  show
 
Gm7                            Fm7
   Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
Gm7                     Fm7
   Oh but seeing you is believing
Gm7
    That's why I don't know why
A
   You didn't show up that night
 
 
[Chorus]
      Dm      Em     F  Am7 G
There must be some misun der standing
      Dm      Em  F    Am7   G
There must be some kind of mistake
      Dm      Em    F    Am7 G
I was waiting in the rain for hours
             C
And you were late
 
 
[Verse]
Ab                      Bb             AbM7             Bb   
   Since then I've been running around        trying to find you
Ab               Bb             AbM7   Bb   
   I went to the places that we always go
 
Gm7                              Fm7
    I rang your house but got no answer
Gm7                              Fm7
   so I jumped in my car, I went round again
Gm7
    I still don't believe it
A
   He was just leaving
 
 
[Chorus]
      Dm      Em      F   Am7 G
There must be some mis un  der standing
      Dm   Em     F    Am7    G
There must be some kind of mis take...
      Dm      Em      F  Am7    G
There must be some mis un der standing
      Dm   Em     F    Am7   G
There must be some kind of mistake.
      Dm     Em      F       Am7   G
There must be   there must be    oh oh  misunderstanding
      Dm     Em      F       Am7   G

C D G

<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
G                                 Bm7
You can offer me a diamond-plated pearl;
Em                                    D
You can send me all the riches in the world;
G                                    Bm7
You can tempt me with the palaces of kings;
Em                             D                 G
I'd give 'em back in a big ol' sack and keep the simple things

<span>[CHORUS 1]</span>
             C                           G
I've got the simple things; I've got the rain in spring,
          A                               D
Got spicy chicken wings, and French-fried onion rings

<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
         G                   Bm7
You can line me up a mile of limousines;
    Em                              D
For me it don't add up to a hill o' beans;
         G                           Bm7
I got no hankerin' for grabbin' your gold ring;
       Em                            D                 G
It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things

<span>[VERSE 3]</span>
G                                 Bm7
You can offer me a diamond-plated pearl;
Em                                    D
You can send me all the riches in the world;
G                                    Bm7
You can tempt me with the palaces of kings;
Em                             D                 G
I'd give 'em back in a big ol' sack and keep the simple things

<span>[CHORUS 2]</span>
             C                       G
I've got the ocean breeze, under the shady trees,
            A                    D
A two-speed window fan when it's 93 degrees,

<span>[OUTRO]</span>
    G                               Bm7
So forgive me for not grabbin' your gold ring; 
             Em                      D                  G     C   G
It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things
             Em                      D                  G     C   G
It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things

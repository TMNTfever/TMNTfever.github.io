[Verse]:
C                    G
A long long time ago, there was a volcano.
F                        C             G
Living all alone, in the middle of the sea.
C                          G
He sat high above his bay, watching all the couples play,
F                 C              G
and wishing that, he had someone too.
C                            G                             F
And from his lava came, this song of hope that he sang out-loud everyday,
C             G
for years and years.
 
Chorus:
F                  C
I have a dream I hope will come true,
     G7                       C
that you’re here with me and I’m here with you.
F                               C
I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
     F       G7          C
will send me someone to lava.
 
Verse:
C                         G7
Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone,
F                   C                G7
until he was on the brink of extinction.
C                           G7
But little did he know that living in the sea below
F                   C                G7
another volcano was listening to his song.
C                                 G7
Every day she heard his tune. Her lava grew and grew
F                        C                  G7
because she believed his song was meant for her.
C                       G7
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
F                           C            G7
as he sang his song of hope for the last time.
 
Chorus:
F                  C
I have a dream I hope will come true,
     G7                       C
that you’re here with me and I’m here with you.
F                               C
I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
     F       G7          C
will send me someone to lava.
 
Verse:
C                         G7
Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano 
F                      C                 G7
looking all around but she could not see him.
C                                G7
He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone,
    F                C            G7
but with no lava his song was all done.
C                                G7
He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear 
   F                        C             G7
as she remembered what his song meant to her.
 
Chorus -Female-:
F                  C
I have a dream I hope will come true,
     G7                       C
that you’re here with me and I’m here with you.
F                               C
I wish that the earth, sea and the sky up above
     F       G7          C
will send me someone to lava.

Verse:
C                            G7
Oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea,
    F                      C             G7
all together now their lava grew and grew.
C                              G7
No longer are they alone with Aloha as their new home,
    F                    C                 G7
and when you visit them, this is what they sing…
 
Chorus -Female + Male-:
F                C
I have a dream I hope will come true.
             G7
Male: That you'll grow old with me,
             C
Female: and I'll grow old with you.
   F                         C
We thank the earth, sea, and sky we thank too.

Outro:
F  G7  C
I lava YOU!
F  G7  C
I lava YOU!
F  G7  C
I lava YOU!

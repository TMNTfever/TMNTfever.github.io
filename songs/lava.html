[INTRO]
  C  G7  F  C  G7  C
 
[VERSE 1]
C                      G7
  A long long time ago, there was a volcano
F                          C             G7
  Living all alone, in the middle of the sea
C                           G7
  He sat high above his bay, watching all the couples play
F                   C              G7
  And wishing that, he had someone too
C                              G7
  And from his lava came, this song of hope that he sang 
      F             C             G7
  Out-loud everyday for years and years
 
[CHORUS 1]
F                  C
  I have a dream I hope will come true
       G7                      C
  That you're here with me and I'm here with you
    F                             C
  I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
       F       G7         C
  Will send me someone to lava
 
[VERSE 2]
C                            G7
  Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone
F                     C              G7
  Until he was on the brink of extinction
C                             G7
  But little did he know that living in the sea below
F                     C                G7
  Another volcano was listening to his song
C                              G7
  Every day she heard his tune. Her lava grew and grew
F                          C                  G7
  Because she believed his song was meant for her
C                         G7
  Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
     F                        C            G7
  As he sang his song of hope for the last time
 
[CHORUS 2]
F                  C
  I have a dream I hope will come true
       G7                      C
  That you're here with me and I'm here with you
    F                             C
  I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
       F       G7         C
  Will send me someone to lava
 
[VERSE 3]
C                         G7
Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano 
F                      C                 G7
looking all around but she could not see him.
C                                G7
He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone,
    F                C            G7
but with no lava his song was all done.
C                                G7
He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear 
   F                        C             G7
as she remembered what his song meant to her.
 
[CHORUS 3]
F                  C
  I have a dream I hope will come true
       G7                      C
  That you're here with me and I'm here with you
    F                             C
  I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
       F       G7         C
  Will send me someone to lava

[VERSE 4]
C                          G7
  Oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea
  F                      C             G7
  All together now their lava grew and grew
  C                              G7
  No longer are they alone with Aloha as their new home
      F                    C                 G7
  And when you visit them, this is what they sing
 
[CHORUS 4]
F                  C
  I have a dream I hope will come true
       G7
  That you'll grow old with me
      C
  And I'll grow old with you
     F                         C
  We thank the earth, sea, and sky we thank too

[OUTRO]
  F  G7    C
  I  lava you
  F  G7    C
  I  lava you
  F  G7   C
  I  lava you

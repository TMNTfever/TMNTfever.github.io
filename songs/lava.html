<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
<c->C                      G7</c->
<l->  A long long time ago, there was a volcano</l->
<c->F                          C             G7</c->
<l->  Living all alone, in the middle of the sea</l->
<c->C                           G7</c->
<l->  He sat high above his bay, watching all the couples play</l->
<c->F                   C              G7</c->
<l->  And wishing that, he had someone too</l->
<c->C                              G7</c->
<l->  And from his lava came, this song of hope that he sang</l->
<c->      F             C             G7</c->
<l->  Out-loud everyday for years and years</l->
 
<span>[CHORUS 1]</span>
<c->F                  C</c->
<l->  I have a dream I hope will come true</l->
<c->       G7                      C</c->
<l->  That you're here with me and I'm here with you</l->
<c->    F                             C</c->
<l->  I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above</l->
<c->       F       G7         C</c->
<l->  Will send me someone to lava</l->
 
<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
<c->C                            G7</c->
<l->  Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone</l->
<c->F                     C              G7</c->
<l->  Until he was on the brink of extinction</l->
<c->C                             G7</c->
<l->  But little did he know that living in the sea below</l->
<c->F                     C                G7</c->
<l->  Another volcano was listening to his song</l->
<c->C                              G7</c->
<l->  Every day she heard his tune. Her lava grew and grew</l->
<c->F                          C                  G7</c->
<l->  Because she believed his song was meant for her</l->
<c->C                         G7</c->
<l->  Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea</l->
<c->     F                        C            G7</c->
<l->  As he sang his song of hope for the last time</l->

<l->  I have a dream I hope will come true</l->
<c->       G7                      C</c->
<l->  That you're here with me and I'm here with you</l->
<c->    F                             C</c->

<span>[VERSE 3]</span>
<c->  C                         G7</c->
<l->  Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano</l->
<c->  F                      C                 G7</c->
<l->  Looking all around but she could not see him</l->
<c->     C                             G7</c->
<l->  He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone</l->
<c->      F                C            G7</c->
<l->  But with no lava his song was all done</l->
<c->     C                                 G7</c->
<l->  He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear</l->
<c->     F                       C             G7</c->
<l->  As she remembered what his song meant to her</l->

<span>[VERSE 4]</span>
<c->C                          G7</c->
<l->  Oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea</l->
<c->  F                      C             G7</c->
<l->  All together now their lava grew and grew</l->
<c->  C                              G7</c->
<l->  No longer are they alone with Aloha as their new home</l->
<c->      F                    C                 G7</c->
<l->  And when you visit them, this is what they sing</l->
 
<span>[CHORUS 4]</span>
<c->F                  C</c->
<l->  I have a dream I hope will come true</l->
<c->       G7</c->
<l->  That you'll grow old with me</l->
<c->      C</c->
<l->  And I'll grow old with you</l->
<c->     F                         C</c->
<l->  We thank the earth, sea, and sky we thank too</l->

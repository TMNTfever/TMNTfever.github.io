[VERSE 1]
          Dm             C              Bb    A7
  As I sail with you across the finest o-ceans
           Dm              C          Bb    A7
  On our way to find the key to our emotions
            Dm                 C                Bb  A7
  Together we will move the clouds to brighter days
              Dm                C           Bb                A7
  Some people question what I say, tried to break up you and me

[REFRAIN 1] (Half-time)
                   Dm           C                 Bb  A7
  But I know this love between us is growing stronger
                      Dm            C              Bb     A7
  You can call me whenever from wherever, just remember that
              Dm          C              Bb    A7
  I'll be there through all the stormy weather
               Dm      C             Bb       A7
  Us break up never, no, we'll be together forever

[CHORUS 1]
  Dm                   C                       Bb  A7
  You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry
            Dm            C            Bb  A7
  But I believe so strongly in you and I
  Dm            C                     Bb         A7
  Can somebody answer me the question why, oh why
  Bb                   C                       F      A7
  You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry, mmhmm

[VERSE 2]
         Dm                C              Bb     A7
  As I close my eyes, sit back while reminiscing
              Dm                  C             Bb     A7
  Of when we used to fuss and fight but end up kissing
                Dm              C               Bb  A7
  There may be sad and painful times along the way
            Dm                   C          Bb             A7
  But in my heart you'll always be everything and more to me

  You can call me whenever from wherever, just remember that
              Dm          C              Bb    A7

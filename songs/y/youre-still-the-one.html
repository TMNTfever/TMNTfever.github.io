  G                     C                 D
Looks like we made it, Look how far we've come my baby
  G                          C            D
We mighta took the long way, We knew we'd get there someday
  G                 C           D
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
         G          C      D
But just look at us holding on
                G           C      D
We're still together still going strong

C                  G
You're still the one
                        C
You're still the one I run to
 Am              D
The one that I belong to
  G                     C         D
You're still the one I want for life
C                  G
You're still the one
                          C
You're still the one that I love
 Am              D
The only one I dream of
  G                     C          D
You're still the one I kiss good night
</div>
<div><s->[VERSE 2]</s->
  G
Ain't nothin' better
  C          D
We beat the odds together
  G
I'm glad we didn't listen
  C               D
Look at what we would be missin'
  G                 C           D
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
         G          C      D
But just look at us holding on
                G           C      D
We're still together still going strong

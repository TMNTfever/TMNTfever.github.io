<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
          Dm             C              Bb    A7
  As I sail with you across the finest o-ceans
           Dm              C          Bb    A7
  On our way to find the key to our emotions
            Dm                 C                Bb  A7
  Together we will move the clouds to brighter days
              Dm                C           Bb                A7
  Some people question what I say, tried to break up you and me

<r->[REFRAIN 1]</r-> (half-time)
                   Dm           C                 Bb  A7
  But I know this love between us is growing stronger
                      Dm            C              Bb     A7
  You can call me whenever from wherever, just remember that
              Dm          C              Bb    A7
  I'll be there through all the stormy weather
               Dm      C             Bb       A7
  Us break up never, no, we'll be together forever

<div class="focus"><r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
  You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry
  But I believe so strongly in you and I
  Can somebody answer me the question why
  You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry
</div>
<div><s->[VERSE 2]</s->
  As I close my eyes, sit back while reminiscing
  Of when we used to fuss and fight but end up kissing
  There may be sad and painful times along the way
  But in my heart you'll always be everything and more to me

<r->[REFRAIN 2]</r->
  (Same as Refrain 1, except first word is "for" not "but")

<r->[CHORUS 2]</r->
  (Same as Chorus 1)

<s->[BRIDGE]</s->
  For you are always on my mind
  You are always on my mind
  Girl you know that you you are always
  You are always on my mind
  You are always forever

<r->[CHORUS 3]</r-> x 2
  (Same as Chorus 1)

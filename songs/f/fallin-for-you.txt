[VERSE 1]
C                 Em          F                G
  I dont know but, I think I may be fallin' for you, dropping so quickly
C                Em                   F             G

[REFRAIN 1]
       F             Am7             Dm              Em
  I am trying not to tell you, but I want to, I'm scared of what you'll say
             F               Em   Am7           Dm       F            G

[VERSE 2]
C                     Em
  As I'm standing here and you hold my hand
F                    G
  Pull me towards you and we start to dance
C               Em

  Here in silence, it's just you and me

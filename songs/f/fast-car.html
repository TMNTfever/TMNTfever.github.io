  You got a fast car, I want a ticket to anywhere - maybe we make a deal, maybe together we can get somewhere
  CM7          G       Em                      D                 CM7              G          Em               D
  Any place is better, starting from zero, got nothing to lose - maybe we'll make something, me myself I got nothing to prove

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->

  You got a fast car, I got a plan to get us out of here
  CM7                   G                  Em                     D
  I been working at the convenience store, managed to save just a little bit of money
  CM7                     G    Em                         D
  Won't have to drive too far, just 'cross the border and into the city 
  CM7           G                  Em                  D
  You and I can both get jobs, and finally see what it means to be living
 
<s->[VERSE 3]</s->
           CM7                G           Em                               D
  You see, my old man's got a problem, he live with the bottle, thatâ€™s the way it is
              CM7                G            Em                  D
  He says his body's too old for working, his body's too young to look like his
     CM7               G             Em                         D
  My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give
          CM7                    G               Em                       D
  I said, somebody's got to take care of him, so I quit school and that's what I did
 
<s->[VERSE 4]</s->
  CM7            G              Em                    D
  You got a fast car, but is it fast enough so we can fly away
  CM7               G       Em                      D
  We gotta make a decision, leave tonight or live'n die this way

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
        (D)                  C                                 G 
  So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car, the speed so fast that I felt drunk
Em                                        D    
  City lights lay out before us, and your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
      C    Em      D
  And I-ee-I had a feeling that I belonged
      C    Em      D                           C          Em
  And I-ee-I had a feeling I could-be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
CM7            G
You got a fast car.
    Em                     D
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves;
CM7                   G
you still ain't got a job
      Em                    D
And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
CM7                    G
I know things will get better:
Em                   D
You'll find work and I'll get promoted, 
CM7                   G
We'll move out of the shelter
Em                     D
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.

<r->[CHORUS 2]</r->
  (Same as Chorus 1)
 
[Verse 6]
CM7            G
You got a fast car.
    Em               D
And I got a job that pays all our bills.
CM7                   G
You stay out drinking late at the bar,
        Em                         D
You see more your friends than you do your kids.
CM7                  G
I'd always hoped for better,
Em                     D
Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
CM7                    G
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere,
   Em                     D
so take your fast car and keep on driving.

<r->[CHORUS 3]</r->
  (Same as Chorus 1)

[Verse 7]
CM7            G
You got a fast car.
          Em                     D
But is it fast enough so you can fly away?
CM7                G
You gotta make a decision:
Em                        D
Leave tonight or live and die this way.

           Dm                Gm       C                  F

<s->[IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT]</s-> (Chords take up a full measure)

  Shoo-doop shooby doo, shoo-doop shooby whoa

  Shoo-doop shooby doo, shoo-doop shooby whoa

  In the still of the night, I held you, held you tight

  Girl I love, love you so, promise I'll never let you go

  In the still of night, in the still of the night

<s->[STAND BY ME]</s->

  5 7 8 8, 5 7 8 8, 8 7 6 6, 5 6 6, 6 5 4 4, 4 6 5 5

  When the night has come, and the moon is the only light you see

  No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid, just as long as you stand

  Stand by me, so darlin, darlin stand by me

  Oh stand by me, oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

<s->[BEAUTIFUL GIRLS]</s->

  You're way too beautiful girl, that's why it'll never work

  You have me suicidal, suicidal when you say it's over

  Damn all these beautiful girls, they only wanna do you dirt

  They'll have you suicidal, suicidal when they say it's over

<s->[BLANK SPACE]</s->

  Nice to meet you, where you been, I could show you incredible things

  Magic, madness, heaven, sin, saw you there and I thought

  Oh my God, look at that face, you look like my next mistake, love's a game, wanna play


  So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames

  You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain

  Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane

  But I've got a blank space, baby, and I'll write your name

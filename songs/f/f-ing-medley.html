  For your love, oh, I would do anything
  I would do anything, for your love
  For your kiss, oh, I would go anywhere
  I would go anywhere, for your kiss

<s->[OH DONNA]</s->
  I had a girl and Donna was her name

  Since she left me, I've never been the same

  Cause I love my girl, Donna oh where can you be, where can you be

  Oh Donna, oh donna, oh donna, oh donna

<s->[SILHOUETTE]</s->
  Took a walk and passed your house late last night

  All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight

  From within the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade

  Oh a what a lovely couple they made

  Silhouette, sillhouette, silhouette, oh oh oh

  Silhouette, sillhouette, silhouette, oh oh oh

<s->[BLUE MOON]</s->

  Blue moon, you saw me standing alone

  Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own

<s->[HEART AND SOUL]</s->

  Heart and soul, I fell in love with you

  Heart and soul, the way a fool would do

  Madly, because you held me tight, and stole a kiss in the night

<s->[WHAT'S YOUR NAME]</s->
  What's your name, I have seen you before
  What's your name, may I walk you to your door
  It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me
  Oo wee, oo wee, oo wee

<s->[IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT]</s-> (Chords take up a full measure)
  Shoo-doop shooby doo, shoo-doop shooby whoa

  Shoo-doop shooby doo, shoo-doop shooby whoa

  In the still of the night, I held you, held you tight

  Girl I love, love you so, promise I'll never let you go

  In the still of night, in the still of the night

<s->[STAND BY ME]</s->
  5 7 8 8, 5 7 8 8, 8 7 6 6, 5 6 6, 6 5 4 4, 4 6 5 5

  When the night has come, and the moon is the only light you see

  No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid, just as long as you stand

  Stand by me, so darlin, darlin stand by me

  Oh stand by me, oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

<s->[BEAUTIFUL GIRLS]</s->
  You're way too beautiful girl, that's why it'll never work
  You have me suicidal, suicidal when you say it's over
  Damn all these beautiful girls, they only wanna do you dirt
  They'll have you suicidal, suicidal when they say it's over

<s->[BLANK SPACE]</s->
  Nice to meet you, where you been, I could show you incredible things
  Magic, madness, heaven, sin, saw you there and I thought
  Oh my God, look at that face, you look like my next mistake, love's a game, wanna play
  
  So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
  But I've got a blank space, baby, and I'll write your name

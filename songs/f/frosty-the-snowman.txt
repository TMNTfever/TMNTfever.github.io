[VERSE 1]
  G                         C           G
  Frosty the Snowman, was a jolly happy soul
         C                   G                   D7               G
  With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal
  G                        C               G
  Frosty the Snowman, is a fairy tale they say
         C                    G                    C       D7       G
  He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day

[BRIDGE 1]
        C                   Bm            Am                G
  There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
      D                B7               Em     A7     D
  For when they put it on his head he began to dance around
      G                       C                G
  Oh, Frosty the Snowman was alive as he could be
          C                     G                       C       D7      G
  And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me

[VERSE 2]
  G                           C                G
  Frosty the Snowman knew the sun was hot that day
        C                          G                   C      D7    G
  So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away"
  G                           C                 G
  Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand
          C                   G                         C        D7     G
  Running here and there all around the square saying, "Catch me if you can"

[BRIDGE 2]
     C                 Bm                    Am             G
  He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
         D             B7             Em        A7       D
  And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, "Stop!"
  G                         C            G
  Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way
         C                        G                      C     D7       G
  But he waved good-bye, saying, "Don't you cry, I'll be back again someday"

  G                                                          D7
  Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump, look at Frosty go
  G                                                    D7       G
  Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump, over the hills of snow

<l->  With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal</l->
<c->  G                        C               G</c->

<l->  There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found</l->
<c->      D                B7               Em     A7     D</c->
<l->  For when they put it on his head he began to dance around</l->
<c->      G                       C                G</c->
<l->  Oh, Frosty the Snowman was alive as he could be</l->

<c->        C                          G                   C      D7    G</c->
<l->  So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away"</l->
<c->  G                           C                 G</c->
<l->  Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand</l->
<c->          C                   G                         C        D7     G</c->

<l->  He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop</l->
<c->         D             B7             Em        A7       D</c->
<l->  And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, "Stop!"</l->
<c->  G                         C            G</c->

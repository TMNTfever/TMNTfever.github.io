G                                     C               G
Frosty the Snow Man, was a jolly happy soul
            C                           G
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
             D                        G
and two eyes made out of coal.
G                                     C                   G
Frosty the Snow Man, is a fairy tale they say
              C                              G       
He was made of snow but the children know
             C     D7    G
how he came to life one day.

Bridge:
            C                              Bm             Am                    G
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found,
         D                   B7                   Em     A7    D
For when they put it on his head he began to dance   around.
          G                                 C                       G
Oh, Frosty the Snow Man was alive as he could be,
               C                           G                        
And the children say he could laugh and play
              C       D7    G
just the same as you and me.

Repeat Intro

G                                            C                       G
Frosty the Snow Man knew the sun was hot that day,
           C                                  G                       
So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun
           C     D7    G
now before I melt     away."
G                                          C                    G
Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand,
               C                        G                       
Running here and there all around the square,
             C       D7    G
saying "Catch me if you   can."

Bridge 2:
      C                               Bm                    Am             G
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop,
             D                   B7                      Em      A7    D
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, "Stop!"
G                                        C                 G
Frosty the Snow Man had to hurry on his way,
             C                                   G                        
But he waved good-bye, saying, "Don't you cry;
          C     D7      G
I'll be back again some day."

Outro:
G 
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump,
                       D7
Look at Frosty go.
G    
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump,
G        D7     G
over the hills of   snow

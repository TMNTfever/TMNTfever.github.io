[VERSE 1]
                              C  CM7  C7
  I've seen it many times before
                             Am  Ama9  Am
  They always seem to get away
                                    Dm7
  Down the stairs you closed the door
         G                           C  CM7  C7
  In the limelight, no, you couldn't stay
                       Am  Ama9           Am               F
  Is it all a grand design, where falling stars run out of time
      Fm             C                  G
  And leave us all behind, oh tell me why

[CHORUS 1]
          Am                    D7
  Tell me why do birds, do they suddenly
  G                    Em7
  Disappear instead of singing here
      Am7                      D7
  Oh, what are we to do, oh we can't believe it's true
           Dm7      G6
  We're so far from you

[VERSE 2]
                      C  CM7  C7
  I listen to the radio
                                Am  Ama9  Am
  Hold my breath to hear you sing
                         Dm7
  Far away and so long ago
          G                    C  CM7  C7
  But without you I lose the beat
                                    Am  Ama9
  Oh, who would write that grand design
                       Am              F
  That pushed blinding stars into your eyes
         Fm              C                 G
  Oh the radio is still live, oh tell me why

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1)
          Am                    D7
  Tell me why do birds, do they suddenly
  G                    Em7
  Disappear instead of singing here
      Am7                      D7
  Oh, what are we to do, oh we can't believe it's true
           Dm7      G6
  We're so far from you

[BRIDGE]
     Dm7                   G
  So far from you, oh I hang on every word
     Dm7                    G
  So far from you, and I sing and your voice, it returns
     Dm7                       G                                 C
  So far from you, and the sound is the most beautiful that I've heard
                G
  Oh, tell me why

[CHORUS 3] (Same as Chorus 1)
          Am                    D7
  Tell me why do birds, do they suddenly
  G                    Em7
  Disappear instead of singing here
      Am7                      D7
  Oh, what are we to do, oh we can't believe it's true
           Dm7      G6
  We're so far from you

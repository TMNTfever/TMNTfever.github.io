[VERSE 1]
  CM7            G    Em                 D
  You got a fast car, I want a ticket to anywhere
  CM7             G     Em                    D
  Maybe we make a deal, maybe together we can get somewhere
  CM7          G       Em                      D
  Any place is better, starting from zero, got nothing to lose
  CM7              G          Em              D
  Maybe we'll make something, me myself I got nothing to prove

[VERSE 2]
  CM7            G    Em              D
  You got a fast car, I got a plan to get us out of here
  CM7                   G                  Em                     D
  I been working at the convenience store, managed to save just a little bit of money
  CM7                     G    Em                         D
  Won't have to drive too far, just across the border and into the city
  CM7           G                  Em                  D
  You and I can both get jobs, and finally see what it means to be living

[VERSE 3]
           CM7                G           Em                               D
  You see, my old man's got a problem, he live with the bottle, thatâ€™s the way it is
              CM7                G            Em                  D
  He says his body's too old for working, his body's too young to look like his
     CM7               G             Em                         D
  My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give
          CM7                    G               Em                       D
  I said, somebody's got to take care of him, so I quit school and that's what I did

[VERSE 4]
  CM7            G              Em                    D
  You got a fast car, but is it fast enough so we can fly away
  CM7               G       Em                      D
  We gotta make a decision, leave tonight or live'n die this way

[CHORUS 1]
        (D)                  C                                 G
  So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car, the speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
Em                                        D
  City lights lay out before us, and your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
      C    Em      D             -
  And I-ee-I had a feeling that I belonged
      C    Em      D               -           C          Em
  And I-ee-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[VERSE 5]
  CM7            G        Em                     D
  You got a fast car, and we go cruising to entertain ourselves
  CM7                   G         Em                    D
  You still ain't got a job, so I work in a market as a checkout girl
  CM7                    G       Em                   D
  I know things will get better, you'll find work and I'll get promoted
  CM7                   G        Em                     D
  We'll move out of the shelter, buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[VERSE 6]
  CM7            G        Em               D
  You got a fast car, and I got a job that pays all our bills
      CM7               G                        Em                         D
  You stay out drinking late at the bar, you see more your friends than you do your kids
  CM7                  G               Em             D
  I'd always hoped for better, thought maybe together you and me would find it
    CM7          G                         Em                     D

[VERSE 7]
  CM7            G              Em                    D

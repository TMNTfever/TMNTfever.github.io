  The first Noel, the angels did say was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
     C            G        F             C           F             Em         F   G  C
  In fields where they lay keeping their sheep, on a cold winter's night that was so deep

[VERSE 2]
       C      G      F     C             F      Em      F   G    C
  They looked up and saw a star, shining in the east beyond them far
      C      G         F          C          F        Em          F   G   C
  And to the earth, it gave great light, and so it continued both day and night

[VERSE 3]
      C         G     F         C     F          Em            F         G  C
  And by the light of that same star, three wise men came from countries so far
     C          G        F       C            F          Em       F    G  C
  To seek for a King was their intent, and to follow the star wherever it went

       C         G            F     C     F     Em       F       G    C
  This star drew night to the north-west, over Bethlehem it took it's rest
      C        G        F        C           F        Em          F G   C
  And there it did both stop and stay, right over the place where Jesus lay

[VERSE 5]
       C       G        F        C           F      Em   F   G     C
  Then entered in those wise men three, fell reverently upon their knees
      C       G        F      C            F        Em        F   G  C
  And offered there in his presence, their gold and myrrh and frankincense

[VERSE 6]
       C      G        F     C          F       Em     F     G  C
  Then let us all with one accord, sing praises to our heavenly Lord
       C         G          F        C           F        Em        F   G   C
  That hath made heav'n and earth of nought, and with his blood mankind has bought

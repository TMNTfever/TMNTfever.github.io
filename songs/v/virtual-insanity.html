Ebm7 Ab7     Db9      GbM7
     Ooh,    He - ey, oh
Cm7b5                BM7                 Bb+7
What we're living in,     let me tell ya

<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
       Ebm7           Ab7
It's a wonder man can eat at all
     Db9                 GbM7
When things are big that should be small
Cm7b5             BM7
Who can tell what magic spells
Bb+7           Ebm7
Will be doing for us?
        Ebm7          Ab7
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Db9        GbM7
   Only to be told
Cm7b5         BM7
I can't see, I can't breathe,
Bb+7             Ebm7 | GbM7
no more will we be
    Ab7                           Db9
And nothing's going to change the way we live
     GbM7                   Cm7b5
Cos' we can always take but never give
  BM7                           Bb+7
An' now that things're changing for the worse, see
Ebm7
    Woah,
Ab7                   Db9
     It's a crazy world we're living in
GbM7                  Cm7b5
     And I just can't see that
        BM7             Bb+7          Bb7  -  Dm7b5
Half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these
</div>
<div class="focus"><r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
  BM7     Ddim7    Ebm7 - GbM7    Abm7 - Bb7
  Futures made of virtu - al    insani  - ty now
  BM7    Ddim7       Ebm7 - GbM7    Abm7 -  Bb7
  Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
  BM7      Ddim7    Ebm7 - GbM7   Abm7 - Bb7
  Useless, twisting of the new techno - logy
      BM7             Ddim7         Ebm7  -  GbM7   Abm7 | Bb7
  Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under - ground
</div>
<div><s->[VERSE 2]</s->
         Ebm7           Ab7
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Db9                GbM7
Hard to know where to begin
   Cm7b5            BM7
If I could slip the sickly ties
     Bb+7   -  Dm7b5   Ebm7 | GbM7
That earthly   man has made
    Ab7       Db9    GbM7              Cm7b5
And now every mother can choose the colour
BM7               Bb+7     |    Dm7b5    Ebm7 - GbM7
     Of her child,   that's not nature's way
      Ab7                        Db9
Well that's what they said yesterday
        GbM7                   Cm7b5
There's nothing left to do but pray
  BM7                     Bb+7  - Dm7b5  Ebm7 |  GbM7
I think it's time I found a new  eligion,  wo  - ah,
     Ab7          Db9           GbM7
it's so insane to synthesize another strain
        Cm7b5              BM7             Bb+7   |  Dm7b5
There's something in these futures that we have  to be told

<r->[CHORUS 2]</r->
  (Same as Chorus 1)

<b->[BRIDE]</b->
  BM7                  Ddim7      Ebm7  -  GbM7   Abm7 - Bb7
  Now there is no sound     if we all live under-ground
  BM7                        Ddim7
      And now it's virtual insanity
     Ebm7 -   GbM7     Abm7 - Bb7
  Forget your virtual real -  ity
  BM7                      Ddim7    Ebm7 - GbM7    Abm7 - Bb7
       Oh, there's nothing so bad.       I know   ye - ah

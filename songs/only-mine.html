<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
                         FM7  
  Like the belle of the ball
Am                     F7
  I bet you've got it all
        Bb6     Bbm6    FM7  
  Just staring at your smile
         C7               FM7  C7
  But I know you're only mine


<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
                        FM7  
  Like the stars out at night
Am             F7
  All the telescopes
       Bb6     Bbm6    FM7  
  Are pointed at your glow
         C7               FM7  F7
  But I know you're only mine


<span>[BRIDGE 1]</span>
               Bb6             C7 
  And I would go as far as to say
                   FM7            F7
  Your eyes would only look this way
        Bb6                    G7
  With my kiss you'd know just where to go
C7    C#7       C7  C#7  C7
  And where to stay


<span>[VERSE 3]</span>
                   FM7  
  On the count of four
Am                    F7
  We'll both hit the floor
          Bb6     Bbm6     FM7  
  As I'm drowning in your eyes
           C7               FM7  C7
  Cause I know you're only mine

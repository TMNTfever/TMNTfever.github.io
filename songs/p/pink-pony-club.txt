[Verse 1]
C         Dm
I know you wanted me to stay
      Am                            F
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA and
C           Dm
I heard that there's a special place
      Am                             F
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day

[Verse 2]
C         Dm
I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Am                          F
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
C                 Dm
Black lights and a mirror disco ball
Am                          F
Every night's another reason why I left it all

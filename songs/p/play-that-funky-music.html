<s->[INTRO]
                 R1
  Hey, do it now
R1
  Hey hey

<s->[VERSE 1]
         R1                   R1
  Once I was a boogie singer, playin in a rock-and-roll band
    R1                    R1
  I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands
      R1                   R1
  And everything around me got to start to feelin' so low
      R1
  And I decided quickly (yes I did)
     R1                                E D E
  To disco down and check out the show

<s->[REFRAIN 1] (strum on upbeats)
                 Bm6
  Yeah they were dancin, and singin, and movin' to the groovin
      Bm6
  And just when it hit me, somebody turned around and shouted

<s->[CHORUS 1]
  R2                              R2
  Play that funky music white boy play that funky music right
  R2                      Fm6
  Play that funky music white boy
  -                                                       R1
  Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die

<s->[INTERLUDE 1]
            R1       R1
  Til you die, hey hey

<s->[VERSE 2]
  I tried to understand this, I thought that they were out of their minds
  How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind
  So still I kept on fighting, well losing every step by the way (we can do)
  I said I must go back there (I got to go back)
  And check to see if things still the same

<s->[REFRAIN 2]
  (Same as Refrain 1)

<s->[CHORUS 2]
  (Same as Chorus 1)

<s->[INTERLUDE 2]
  'Til you die?
  Oh, 'til you die
  Gonna play some electrified funky music
  Hey, wait a minute

<s->[VERSE 3]
  Now first it wasn't easy changing rock-and-rolling minds
  And things were gettin' shaky, I thought I'd have to leave it behind
  Oh, but now it's so much better (it's so much better)
  I'm funking out in every way
  But I'll never lose that feelin' (you know I won't)
  Of how I learned my lesson that day

<s->[REFRAIN 3]
  (Same as Refrain 1)

<s->[CHORUS 3]
  (Same as Chorus 1)

<s->[INTERLUDE 3]
  Til you die
  Oh, til you die
  They shouted

<s->[BRIDGE]
  Play that funky music
  Play that funky music
  Play that funky music
  You got to keep on playin funky music
  Play that funky music
  Play that funky music
  Play that funky music
  Gonna take you high and low

<s->[CHORUS 4]
  (Same as Chorus 1)

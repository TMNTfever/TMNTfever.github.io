[VERSE 1]
C            G        Am           F  G7
  Well I remember when we were in love
C            G            Am           F  G7
  Inseperable my baby like a hand and glove
C                 G          Am                 F  G7
  But things have changed and you're no longer there
C              G               Am                    F  G7
  And all you have to know girl is that I will take care

  Put a little faith in your mind (in your mind)

  We take a walk on the beach girl and write our names in the sand
C                   G        Am                 F  G7
  But things have changed and you're no longer there

[INTRO]
                R1      Rl
  Hey, do it now, hey hey

[VERSE 1]
         R1                   R1
  Once I was a boogie singer, playin in a rock-and-roll band
    R1                    R1
  I never had no problems burnin down the one-night stands
      R1                   R1
  And everything around me got to start to feelin' so low
      R1
  And I decided quickly (yes I did)
     R1                               E D E
  To disco down and check out the show

[REFRAIN 1] (Strum on upbeats)
                 Bm6
  Yeah they were dancin, and singin, and movin' to the groovin
      Bm6
  And just when it hit me, somebody turned around and shouted

[CHORUS 1]
  R2                              R2
  Play that funky music white boy play that funky music right
  R2                      Fm6
  Play that funky music white boy
  -                                                       R1
  Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die

[INTERLUDE 1]
            R1       R1
  Til you die, hey hey

[VERSE 2]
    R1                          R1
  I tried to understand this, I thought that they were out of their minds
      R1                       R1
  How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind
     R1                             R1
  So still I kept on fighting, well losing every step by the way (we can do)
    R1
  I said I must go back there (I got to go back)
      R1                                   E D E
  And check to see if things still the same

[REFRAIN 2] (Same as Refrain 1)
                 Bm6
  Yeah they were dancin, and singin, and movin' to the groovin

  Lay down that boogie and play that funky music 'til you die

[INTERLUDE 2]
R1
  Til you die, oh til you die
                   R1
  Gonna play some electrified funky music, hey, wait a minute

[VERSE 3]
      R1                   R1
  Now first it wasn't easy changing rock-and-rolling minds
      R1                          R1
  And things were gettin shaky, I thought I'd have to leave it behind
         R1
  Oh but now it's so much better (it's so much better)
      R1
  I'm funking out in every way
           R1
  But I'll never lose that feelin' (you know I won't)
     R1                              E D E
  Of how I learned my lesson that day

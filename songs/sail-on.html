[VERSE 1]
C
  Sail on, down the line 'bout a
Dm
  Half a mile or so, and I
F
  Don't really wanna know where uh
C 
  Where you're going
C
  Maybe once or twice you see
Dm
  That time after time I tried to
F
  Hold on to what we got, but
C                  CM7  C7
  Now you're going


[REFRAIN 1]
F           G7
  And I don't mind
            C                    CM7  C7
  About the things you're gonna sail on
F             G7              C  CM7  C7
  I gave all my money and my time
F                G7
  I know it's a shame
          Em         F         C   G  F  C>F
  But I'm giving you back your name


[CHORUS 1]
        F       Em    Dm
  Guess I'll be on my way
    F        Em      Dm
  I won't be back to stay
    F          Em    Dm
  I guess I'll move along
                    C    G
  I'm looking for a good time

[VERSE 2]
C
  Sail on down the line, ain't it
Dm
  Funny how the time can go, all my
F
  Friends say they told me so, but it
C
  Doesn't matter
C
  It was plain to see
Dm
  That a small town boy like me
F
  Just I wasn't your cup of tea
C                        CM7  C7
  I was wishful thinking


[REFRAIN 2]
F               G7
  I gave you my heart
        C                  CM7  C7
  And I tried to make you happy
F                 G7            C
  And you gave me nothing in return
CM7   C7      F                G7
  You know it ain't so hard to say
            Em          F   C  G  F  C>F
  Would you please just go away


[CHORUS 2]
       F       Em    Dm
  I've thrown away the blues
      F        Em  Dm
  I'm tired of being used
         F    Em   Dm
  I want everyone to know
                    C    G
  I'm looking for a good time
  Bb   F  G
  Good time

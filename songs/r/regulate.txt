[VERSE 1]
           Em               Em7                          D/A                 D
  It was a clear black night, a clear white moon, Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
       C6              C                        Bm7
  Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk, rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

       Em               Em7               D/A                D
  Just hit the east side of the LBC, on a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
         C6              C                                B7
  Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak, all you skirts know what's up with 213

[VERSE 2]
        Em          Em7                    D/A                    D
  So, I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis, some brothers shootin dice, so I said let's do this
    C6                 C                         Bm7
  I jumped out the ride and said what's up, some brothers pulled some gats, so I said I'm stuck

              Em              Em7                                  D/A                  D
  Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve, these hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
       C6                   C                                B7
  Onto bigger better things than some horny tricks, I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

[VERSE 3]
      Em            Em7                    D/A          D
  I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself, I can't believe they takin Warren's wealth
       C6            C                      Bm7
  They took my rings, they took my Rolex, I looked at the brothers, said damn what's next

              Em              Em7                        D/A                               D
  They got my homie hemmed up and they all around, can't none of them see him if they goin straight pound-for-pound
             C6                   C                                B7
  They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown, I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down

[VERSE 4]
           Em              Em7                       D/A                D
  They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin down, I can't believe it's happenin in my own town
           C6            C                          Bm7
  If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate, I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate

   Em            Em7                       D/A              D
  16 in the clip and one in the hole, Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
           C6                  C                         B7
  Now they droppin and yellin, it's a tad bit late, Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

[VERSE 5]
         Em                      Em7                         D/A               D
  I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode, now I'm switchin my mind back into freak mode
  C6                  C                            B7
  If you want skirts, sit back and observe, I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

       Em                  Em7                        D/A               D
  Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact, before I got jacked I was on the same track
  C6               C                    Bm7
  Back up, back up cause it's on, N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

[VERSE 6]
  Em                   Em7                            D/A               D
  Just like I thought, they were in the same spot, in need of some desperate help
C6              C                        B7
  But Nate Dogg and the G child, were in need of somethin else
  Em                Em7                        D/A         D
  One of them dames was sexy as hell, I said, "Ooh, I like your size!"
                C6               C                                Bm7
  She said, "My car's broke down and you seem real nice, would you let me ride?"
          Em                Em7                     D/A D          C6             C       B7
  I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell,    the next stop is the Eastside Motel

[VERSE 7]
      Em         Em7                 D/A          D
  I'm tweaking into a whole new era, G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
  C6   C                         Bm7
  Funk on a whole new level, the rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
  Em     Em7          D/A   D        C6     C                     B7
  Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk, where rhythm is life and life is rhythm

Em            Em7          D/A                  D
  If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this
C6           C                Bm7
  It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
Em             Em7                       D/A           D
  If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like every day
C6              C               B7        (Em)
  And if yo ass is a busta, 2-1-3 will regulate

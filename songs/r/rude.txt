[VERSE 1]
D          E                     A        F#m
  Saturday morning jumped out of bed, and put on my best suit
D           E                    A    F#m
  Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
D                 E                     A        F#m
  Knocked on your door with heart in my hand, to ask you a question
D                   E                       A     F#m
  Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah

[REFRAIN 1] (whole notes)

  Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life
      A                     F#m
  Say yes, say yes, cause I need to know
               D                               E
  You say I'll never get your blessing til the day I die
        A                       F#m
  Tough luck my friend, but the answer is no

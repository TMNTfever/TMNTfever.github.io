[VERSE 1]
G                          D
  My head is stuck in the clouds
G                    D            Em          D       C
  She begs me to come down says, "Boy, quit foolin' around"
     D       G                          D
  I told her, "I love the view from up here
G                              D
  The warm sun and wind in my ear
        Em        D           C           D7                    G  G7
  We'll watch the world from above, as it turns to the rhythm of love

[CHORUS 1]
         C             G
  We may only have tonight
          C                   G    B7  Em 
  Til the morning sun you're mine, all mine
           D     C        D7                  G     D  G  D
  Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love

[VERSE 2]
G                        D
  My heart beats like a drum
G                         D       Em        D           C
  A guitar string to the strum, a beautiful song to be sung
  D        G                        D
  She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
G                                         D
  That roll back when she's laughing at me
      Em    D           C         D                   G
  She rises up like the tide, the moment her lips meet mine

           D     C        D7                  G     D  G  D
  Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love

[BRIDGE]
B7         Em      G     D
  When the moon is low
B7       Em       G    D C
  We can dance in slow motion
               D             C                  D7         G
  And all your fears will subside, and all your tears will dry

G                      D   G                         D
  And long after I've gone, you'll still be humming along
      Em          D         C         D                    G
  And I will keep you in my mind, the way you make love so fine

  I know that when you look at me, there's so much that you just don't see
      CM7          Am7                   Dm7                    G7
  But if you would only take the time, I know in my heart you'd find
  G#o7   Am                               Fm
  Ohhh a girl who's scared sometimes, who isn't always strong
  C                               Dm7          G7
  Can't you see the hurt in me? I feel so all alone

[CHORUS 1]
          F            G            C            A7

            Dm7                       G                 G7
  Won't you hold me in your arms, and keep me safe from harm
          F            G             C             A7

       CM7       Am7                    F             Fm
  Each day, each day I play the role of someone whose always in control
         CM7          Am7
  But at night I come home and turn the key
          Dm7                  G7        G#o7  Am
  There's nobody there, no one cares for me ohhhh
                             Fm
  What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
      C                             Dm7                   G
  Without someone to share it with, tell me what does it mean?

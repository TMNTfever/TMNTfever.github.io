[INTRO] (Rolled chords)
C                                    Am
  Here's my story, it's sad but true, it's about a girl that I once knew
F                                  G
  She took my love, then ran around with every single guy in town

[VERSE 1]
      C                                            Am
  Well, I should have known it from the very start, this girl would leave me with a broken heart
F                                        G
  Now listen people what I'm telling you, I keep away from Runaround Sue, ah yeah
C                                              Am
  Her amazing lips and the smile from her face, the touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
F                                       G
  So if you don't want to cry like I do, keep away from Runaround Sue

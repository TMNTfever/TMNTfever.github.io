[VERSE 1] (bass-only in first half, uke-roll last half)
 -                                        -
  I just wanna stay in the sun where I find, I know it’s hard sometimes
 -                                         -
  Pieces of peace in the sun’s peace of mind, I know it’s hard sometimes
F                                           Dm
  Yeah I think about the end just way too much, but it’s fun to fantasize
F                                       Dm
  On my enemies I wouldn’t wish who I was, but it’s fun to fantasize

[CHORUS 1] (uke-chuck first half, elec-roll last half)
  F                           Dm                                  F
  Oh oh whoa, oh oh whoa, I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride
                  Dm                       -          F  Gm|Dm
  Oh oh whoa, I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride
            Bb |       F  Gm|Dm  C
  Taking my time on my ride

[VERSE 2] (uke-chuck)
       F
  "I'd die for you," that's easy to say, we all have a list of people that we would take
    Dm
  A bullet for them, a bullet for you, a bullet for everybody in this room
        F
  But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through, see many bullets coming through
  Dm
  Metaphorically I'm the man, but literally I don't know what I'd do

       F
  "I'd live for you," and that's hard to do, even harder to say when you know it's not true
       Dm
  Even harder to write when you know that tonight, that the people back home tried talking to you
      F
  But you ignored them still, all these questions they’re for real
                     Dm
  Like who would you live for? Who would you die for? And would you ever kill?

[CHORUS 2] (uke-chuck first half, elec-roll last half)
  F                           Dm                                  F
  Oh oh whoa, oh oh whoa, I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride
                  Dm                       -          F  Gm|Dm
  Oh oh whoa, I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride
            Bb |       F  Gm|Dm  C
  Taking my time on my ride

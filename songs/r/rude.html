<s->[VERSE 1]</s-> 
    D         E                   A
  Saturday morning jumped out of bed
       F#m
  And put on my best suit
   D         E                    A
  Got in my car and raced like a jet
   F#m
  All the way to you
    D               E                    A
  Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
      F#m
  To ask you a question
     D                 E                      A    F#m
  'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah
 
<r->[REFRAIN 1]</r->
   D                                E
  Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
       A                     F#m
  Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
                 D                               E
  You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
         A                          F#m
  Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'
 
<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
   D             E         A                   F#m
  Why you gotta be so rude, don't you know I'm human too
   D            E          A          F#m
  Why you gotta be so rude, I'm gonna marry her anyway
   D               E
  Marry that girl, marry her anyway
   A              F#m
  Marry that girl, no matter what you say
   D                   E
  Marry that girl, And we'll be a family
   A            F#m   D E
  Why you gotta be so rude
    A           F#m   D E A F#m
  Why you gotta be so rude
 
<s->[VERSE 2]</s-> 
   D         E                      A
  I hate to do this, you leave no choice
         F#m
  Can't live without her
   D             E               A
  love me or hate me we will be boys
            F#m
  Standing at that altar
   D         E
  Or we will run away
   A                   F#m
  To another galaxy, you know
       D             E
  You know she's in love with me
   A             F#m
  She will go anywhere I go

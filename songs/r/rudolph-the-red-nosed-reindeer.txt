[CHORUS]
  G                                                          D
  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer) had a very shiny nose (like a lightbulb)
                                                         G
  And if you ever saw it (saw it), you would even say it glows (like a glowstick)
                                                                  D
  All of the other reindeer (reindeer) used to laugh and call him names (like Pinocchio)
                                                             G
  They never let poor Rudolph (Rudolph) play in any reindeer games (like Monopoly)

[BRIDGE]
  C              G              Am    D7      G
  Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say (ho ho ho)
  D                                 A7                 D7
  Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight

  Then how the reindeer loved him (loved him), as they shouted out with glee (yipee)
                                                               G
  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer), you'll go down in history (like George Washington)
  D                   D7 G
  You'll go down in history

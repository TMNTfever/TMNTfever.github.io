[VERSE 1]
              Eb         Gm7       Fm7
  I know your eyes in the morning sun
C7            Fm7             Gm      Bb
  I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
           Eb            Gm7      Cm7
  And the moment that you wander far from me
          Fm7                  Bb
  I wanna feel you in my arms again


[REFRAIN 1]
            Fm7             Gm7
  When you come to me on a summer breeze
           Fm7                        Fm7b5
  Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
            Gm      Cm7     Fm7  Bb
  When it's me you need to show

  How deep is your love


[CHORUS]
      Eb/5                    EbM7
  How deep is your love, how deep is your love
  Fm7               Fm7b5
  I really need to learn
              Eb                    Gm7
  Cause we're living in a world of fools
              C7
  Breaking us down
             C7                Fm7
  When they all should let us be
           Abm6
  We belong to you and me


[VERSE 2]
Eb    Gm7       Fm7
  I believe in you
C7              Fm7       Gm    Bb
  You know the door to my very soul
              Eb         Gm7       Cm7
  You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
             Fm7           Bb
  You're my savior when I fall


[REFRAIN 2]
           Fm7                  Gm7
  And you may not think that I care for you
           Fm7                     Fm7b5
  But you know down inside that I really do
            Gm      Cm7     Fm7  Bb
  When it's me you need to show

  How deep is your love


(CHORUS)

  La la da da da,     la la da da doo

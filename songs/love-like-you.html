  Eb           Fm
  If I could begin to be
  Gm               Abm
  Half of what you think of me
          Eb       C
  I could do about anything

  When I see the way you act

           Eb                 Gm
  I always thought I might be bad
          Cm             Fm
  Now I’m sure that it’s true
          Bb              Gm
  Cause I think you’re so good

  What makes you think I’m so special


<span>[VERSE 3]</span>
  Eb           Fm
  If I could begin to do
  Gm                  Abm
  Something that does right by you
          Eb       C
  I would do about anything
               Fm           Abm
  I would even learn how to love


<span>[VERSE 4]</span>
  Eb             Fm
  When I see the way you look
  Gm            Abm
  Shaken by how long it took
          Eb       C
  I could do about anything
               Fm           Abm  Eb   C
  I could even learn how to love like you
  Fm           EbM7  
  Love me like you

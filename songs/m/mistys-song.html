[VERSE 1]
  Cs4             Cs2          Am7
  Out here in the quiet of the night
    Em7       Fa9   Em7 Cs4  Gs2
  Beneath the stars and moon
     Cs4                  Cs2              Am7
  We both know we've got something on our minds
     Em7     Fa9  Em7      Cs4
  We won't admit, but it's true
              Gm6 A7      Fm  Cs4
  You look at me,  I look away

[CHORUS 1]
          C                                C7
  I wanna tell you what I'm feeling, but I don't know how to start
          F                                 Fm
  I wanna tell you, but now I'm afraid that you might break my heart
                 Em                    Am7
  Oh, why should anything so easy ever be so hard to do
          F                                G               Cs4  Ga9
  I wanna tell you what I'm feeling and to say that I love you

[VERSE 2]
  I practice all the things that I could say
  Line by line, every word
  I tell myself today could be the day
  But every time I lose my nerve
  I look at you, you look away

[CHORUS 2]
  (Same as Chorus 1)

[BRIDGE]
  Why, why do you turn away
  It must be, you're afraid like me
  I try but I can't pretend that I
  Don't feel for you the way I do, can't you see

[CHORUS 3] x 2
  I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
  But I don't know how to start
  I wanna tell you, but now I'm afraid
  That you might break my heart
  Oh, why should anything so easy ever
  Be so hard to do
  I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
  And to say that I love you

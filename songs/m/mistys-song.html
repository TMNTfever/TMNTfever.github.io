????????????????????????????

Out here in the quiet of the night
Beneath the stars and moon
We both know we've got something on our minds
We won't admit, but it's true
You look at me, I look away

I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
But I don't know how to start
I wanna tell you, but now I'm afraid
That you might break my heart
Oh, why should anything so easy ever
Be so hard to do
I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
And to say that I love you
I practice all the things that I could say
Line by line, every word
I tell myself today could be the day
But every time I lose my nerve
I look at you, you look away
I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
But I don't know how to start
I wanna tell you, but now I'm afraid
That you might break my heart
Oh, why should anything so easy ever
Be so hard to do
I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
And to say that I love you
Why, why do you turn away
It must be, you're afraid like me
(I try) I try but I can't pretend that I
Don't feel for you the way I do, can't you see
I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
But I don't know how to start
I wanna tell you, but now I'm afraid
That you might break my heart
Oh, why should anything so easy ever
Be so hard to do
I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
And to say that I love you
I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
(I wanna say) But I don't know how to start
I wanna tell you, but now I'm afraid
(That I'm afraid) That you might break my heart
Oh, why should anything so easy
('Cause I love you) Ever be so hard to do
I wanna tell you what I'm feeling
And to say that I love you...

  When you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world

  Listen to your heart, those angel voices
D                  A                    G
  They'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home

  You're growing desperate from the fight
D                  A    Bm7               G
  Remember you're loved, and you always will be

  This melody will bring you right back home

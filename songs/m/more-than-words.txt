[VERSE 1]
D           Ga9          Em7                 G       A       D
  Saying "I love you" is not the words I want to hear from you
                  Ga9       Em7               G     A      Bm7
  It's not that I want you, not to say, but if you only knew
      Em    A               D       A       Bm7
  How easy it would be to show me how you feel

[CHORUS 1]
             Em7     A                D7            G
  More than words is all you have to do to make it real
           Gm7              D            Bm7           Em7   A      D
  Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, cause I'd already know
                 A        Bm7       F#m     G
  What would you do if my heart was torn in two
                     D        Em7             A              D
  More than words to show you feel, that your love for me is real
                 A        Bm7        F#m   G
  What would you say if I took those words away
                    D           Em7           A              D
  Then you couldn't make things new, just by saying "I love you"

[VERSE 2]
D               Ga9      Em7              G        A    D
  Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
          Ga9           Em7                 G          A        Bm7
  All you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hand
      Em        A                    D    A      Bm7
  And touch me, hold me close don't ever let me go

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1, except say "show" instead of "real" in first line)
             Em7     A                D7            G
  More than words is all you have to do to make it show
           Gm7              D            Bm7           Em7   A      D
  Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, cause I'd already know
                 A        Bm7       F#m     G
  What would you do if my heart was torn in two
                     D        Em7             A              D
  More than words to show you feel, that your love for me is real
                 A        Bm7        F#m   G
  What would you say if I took those words away
                    D           Em7           A              D
  Then you couldn't make things new, just by saying "I love you"

[VERSE 1]
  Cs4             Cs2          Am7
  Out here in the quiet of the night
    Em7         Fa9 Em7 Cs4  Gs2
  Beneath the stars and moon
     Cs4                  Cs2              Am7
  We both know we've got something on our minds
     Em7     Fa9  Em7      Cs4
  We won't admit, but it's true
              Gm6 A7       Fm  Cs4
  You look at me,  I look away

[CHORUS 1]
          C                                C7
  I wanna tell you what I'm feeling, but I don't know how to start
          F                                 Fm
  I wanna tell you, but now I'm afraid that you might break my heart
                 Em                    Am7
  Oh, why should anything so easy ever be so hard to do
          F                                G               Cs4  Ga9

[VERSE 2]
    Cs4                  Cs2              Am7
  I practice all the things that I could say
  Em7       Fa9 Em7   Cs4  Gs2
  Line by line, every word
    Cs4           Cs2               Am7
  I tell myself today could be the day
      Em7    Fa9  Em7       Cs4
  But every time, I lose my nerve
            Gm6 A7         Fm  Cs4
  I look at you, you look away

  Cs4             Em7
  Why, why do you turn away
  Fa9         G                  Cs4
  It must be, you're afraid like me
    Am7       Em7/B
  I try but I can't pretend that I
        Dm7                        CM7       G
  Don't feel for you the way I do, can't you see

  There must be some misunderstanding, there must be some kind of mistake
    Dm     Em     F    Am   G                  C
  I waited in the rain for hours and you were late
           Dm       Em    F   Am7 G                Dm  Em       F      Am7 G
  Now it's not like me to say the right thing, but you could've called to let me know
    Dm           Em     F      Am7   G                          C
  I checked your number twice, don't understand it, so I went home

[VERSE 1]
G#               A#              G#   A# G#               A#             G#    A#
  Well I'd been waiting for this weekend, I thought that maybe we could see a show
Gm7                           Fm7     Gm7                     Fm7
  Never dreamed I'd have this feeling, oh but seeing you is believing
Gm7                           A
  That's why I don't know why, you didn't show up that night

[CHORUS 2]
        Dm      Em      F Am G               Dm      Em   F       Am G
  There must be some misunderstanding, there must be some kind of mistake
    Dm     Em     F    Am   G              C
  I waited in the rain for hours and you were late

[VERSE 2]
G#                      A#            G#          A#
  Since then I've been running around trying to find you
G#               A#             G#  A#
  I went to the places that we always go
Gm7                              Fm7   Gm7                              Fm7
   I rang your house but got no answer, so I jumped in my car, I went round again
Gm7                        A
  I still don't believe it, he was just leaving

[CHORUS 3]
        Dm      Em      F Am G               Dm      Em   F       Am G
  There must be some misunderstanding, there must be some kind of mistake
         Dm      Em      F Am G

  Dear I feel we're facing a problem, you love me no longer I know and
Cm7              Fm7                 Bb7            Eb
  Maybe there is nothing that I can do, to make you do
  Cm7                 Fm7               Bb7                 EbM7            Cm7
  Mama tells me that I shouldn't bother, said I ought to stick to another girl
                Fm7              Bb7               (Eb)
  A girl that surely deserves me, but I think you do

[REFRAIN 1] (Bass and drum only)
Eb  E      F     Gb         G
  --- So I cry I pray and I beg you

[VERSE 2]
  Cm7           Fm7                   Bb7              EbM7
  Lately I have desperately pondered, spent my nights awake and I wonder
  Cm7               Fm7               Bb7            Eb
  What I could have done in another way, to make you stay
  Cm7             Fm7               Bb7            EbM7
  Reason will not lead to solution, I will end up lost in confusion
Cm7               Fm7                 Bb7               (Eb)
  I don't care if you really care, as long as you don't go

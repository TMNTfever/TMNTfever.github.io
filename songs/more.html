[VERSE 1]
  GM7            Em7              Am7        D7
  More than the greatest love the world has known
GM7            Em7        Am7            D7
  This is the love that I give to you alone
GM7              Em7           Am7     D7
  More than the simple words I try to say
GM7       Em7             Am7        D7
  I only live to love you more each day


[CHORUS]
  Em               D#+
  More than you'll ever know
      G                F#5
  My arms long they to hold you so
     Am7          A7
  My life will be in your keeping
  D7                D#o7
  Waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping


[VERSE 2]
GM7            Em7        Am7         D7
  Longer than always is a long, long time
GM7          Em7         Am7        D7
  But far beyond forever you'll be mine


[OUTRO]
Em          D#+           G
  I know I never lived before
          F#5           Am7
  And my heart is very sure
A7        D7  D#o7
  No one else
          Em              D7  D#o7   GM7/5
  No one else could love you   more

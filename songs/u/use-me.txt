[VERSE 1]
       Em7  A7                           Em7 A7
  My friends, feel it's their appointed duty
                       Em7   A7                       Em7  A7
  They keep trying to tell me, all you want to do is use me
         Em7     A7                         Em7  A7
  But my answer yeah, to all that use me stuff

[CHORUS 1]
                      -
  I-I-I I want to spread the news, that if it feels this good getting used
              -                                   Em7 A7                  Em7 A7
  Oh you just keep on using me, until you use me up,    until you use me up

[VERSE 2]
     Em7     A7                        Em7         A7
  My brother, sit me right down and he talked to me
             Em7    A7                                    Em7    A7
  Uh huh, he told me, that I ought not to let you just walk on me
                     Em7    A7                               Em7  A7
  And I'm sure he meant well, yeah but when our talk was through

[CHORUS 2]
                 -
  I-I-I I said brother if you only knew, you'd wish that you were in my shoes
           -                                   Em7 A7                  Em7 A7
  You just keep on using me, until you use me up,    until you use me up

[VERSE 3]
          Em7  A7                                Em7  A7
  Oh sometimes, yeah it's true you really do abuse me
      Em7                                   A7                      Em7        A7
  You get me in a crowd of high class people, and then you act real rude to me
         Em7             A7                                 Em7   A7
  But oh baby baby baby baby, when you love me I can't get enough

[CHORUS 3]
                  -
  I-I-I I want to spread the news, that if it feels this good getting used
              -                                   Em7 A7                  Em7 A7
  Oh you just keep on using me, until you use me up,    until you use me up

[OUTRO]
  Em7                               A7
  Talking about you using me but it all depends on what you do
     Em7                                            A7
  It ain't too bad the way you're using me, cause I sure am using you-
                       Em7 A7                           Em7 A7
  To do the things you do,  ah ha to do the things you do

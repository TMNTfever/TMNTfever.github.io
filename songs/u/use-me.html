My friends

feel it's their appointed duty
                    Em7     A7
They keep trying to tell me 
                      Em7     A7

My brother 
                                  Em7     A7
sit me right down and he talked to me
       Em7     A7
He told me 
                                  Em7     A7
that I ought not to let you just walk on me
                       Em7     A7
And I'm sure he meant well 
                              Em7     A7
yeah but when our talk was through
 
<r->[CHORUS 2]</r->

you'd wish that you were in my shoes
N.C.
You just keep on using me
                 Em7     A7
until you use me up
                 Em7     A7
Until you use me up

Oh sometimes 
                                  Em7     A7
yeah it's true you really do abuse me
    Em7                                    A7
You get me in a crowd of high class people 
                      Em7        A7
and then you act real rude to me
       Em7            A7
But oh baby baby baby baby 
                                Em7     A7
when you love me I can't get enough
 
<r->[CHORUS 3]</r->
N.C.
I I and I want to spread the news
N.C.
that if it feels this good getting used
N.C.
Oh you just keep on using me
                    Em7     A7
until you use me up
                    Em7     A7
Until you use me up
 
<s->[OUTRO]</s->
Em7                               A7
Talking about you using me but it all depends on what you do
Em7                                              A7
It ain't too bad the way you're using me 'Cause I sure am using you 
Em7                         A7

                                Em7 A7
Ah ha to do the things you do

  My brother, sit me right down and he talked to me
             Em7    A7                                    Em7    A7
  Uh huh, he told me, that I ought not to let you just walk on me
                     Em7    A7                               Em7  A7
  And I'm sure he meant well, yeah but when our talk was through

           -                                   Em7 A7                  Em7 A7
  You just keep on using me, until you use me up,    until you use me up

  Oh sometimes, yeah it's true you really do abuse me
      Em7                                    A7                     Em7        A7
  You get me in a crowd of high class people, and then you act real rude to me
         Em7            A7                                    Em7     A7

  Talking about you using me but it all depends on what you do
  Em7                                             A7
  It ain't too bad the way you're using me, cause I sure am using you

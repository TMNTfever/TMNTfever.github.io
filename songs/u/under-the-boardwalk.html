              G                                          D
  Oh when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
           D                                                   G    G7
  And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire-proof
            C                     G                             D               G
  Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, on a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

           G                                       D
  From the park you hear the happy sound of a carousel
          D                                         G        G7
  You can almost taste the hotdogs and french fries they sell
            C                     G                             D               G
  Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, on a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
            Em
  Under the boardwalk, out of the sun
            D
  Under the boardwalk, we'll be having some fun
            Em
  Under the boardwalk, people walking above
            D
  Under the boardwalk, we'll be falling in love
            Em   Em    Em   Em
  Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

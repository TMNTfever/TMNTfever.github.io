[Verse 1]
       G                                          D
Oh the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
         D                                                   G    G7
And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire-proof
          C                     G
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
     G                 D              G
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be


[Verse 2]
        G                                       D
From the park you hear the happy sound of a carousel
       D                                         G        G7
You can almost taste the hotdogs and french fries they sell
          C                     G
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
     G                 D               G
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be


[Chorus]
          Em
Under the boardwalk, out of the sun
          D
Under the boardwalk, we'll be having some fun
          Em
Under the boardwalk, people walking above
          D
Under the boardwalk, we'll be falling in love
         Em   Em    Em   Em
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
     G                 D               G
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be


[Chorus]
          Em
Under the boardwalk, out of the sun
          D
Under the boardwalk, we'll be having some fun
          Em
Under the boardwalk, people walking above
          D
Under the boardwalk, we'll be falling in love
         Em   Em    Em   Em
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

              G                                            D
  Oh when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
           D7                                                  G     G7

  Under the boardwalk, down by the sea-yeah, under the blanket with my baby is where I'll be

  Under the boardwalk, out of the sun
            D
  Under the boardwalk, we'll be having some fun
            Em
  Under the boardwalk, people walking above
            D
  Under the boardwalk, we'll be falling in love
            Em   Em    Em   Em
  Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

          D7                                           G      G7
  You can almost taste the burgers and french fries they sell
               C                     G                 G7                 D7            G    G7

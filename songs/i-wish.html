[INTRO] x 4
  Am  D7
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am              D7     Am          D7          Am  D7  Am  D7
 Looking back on when I, was a little nappy headed boy.
Am           D7    Am                D7              Am  D7  Am  D7
 Then my only worry, was for Christmas; what would be my toy.
 
 
[Bridge 1]
 
E7             F#7        Bm7             Dm6
 Even though we sometimes would not get a thing;
E7            F#7       Bm7               E7#5
 We were happy with the joy the day would bring.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am               D7
 Sneaking out the back door,
   Am                 D7                Am  D7  Am  D7
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine.
Am             D7
 Greeted at the back door,
              Am                D7           Am   D7  Am  D7
With; "boy, I thought I told you not to go out-side?"
 
 
[Bridge 2]
 
E7                  F#7        Bm7          Dm6
 Tryin' your best to bring the water to you eyes.
E7                F#7             Bm7              E7#5
 Thinkin' it might stop her, from whoopin' your be-hind.
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
             Am   D7    Am            D7
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
              Am   D7  Am         D7
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go?
 
             Am   D7    Am            D7
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
              Am   D7  Am         D7                 (Am)
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go? 'Cos I love them so.
 
 
[Break]
 
Am  D7          Am             D7
  Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do.
Am  D7          Am             D7
  Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do.
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Am                D7
 Brother says he's tellin',
Am                D7              Am  D7  Am  D7
 'Bout you playing doctor with that girl.
Am                    D7
 Just don't tell; I'll give you,
Am           D7                     Am   D7  Am  D7
 Anything you want in this whole wide world.
 
 
[Bridge 3]
 
E7             F#7     Bm7        Dm6
 Mama gives you money, for Sunday school,
E7                  F#7     Bm7             E7#5
 You trade yours for candy, after church is through.
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
Am           D7
 Smokin' ciga-rettes and,
    Am               D7          Am  D7         Am  D7
And writing something nasty on the wall, (you nasty boy!)
Am                D7    Am           D7           Am  D7
 Teacher sends you to the principals of-fice down the hall.
 
 
[Bridge 4]
 
E7              F#7          Bm7               Dm6
 You grow up and learn that, kinda thing ain't right.
E7                 F#7           Bm7             E7#5
 But while you were doin' it; it sure felt outta sight.
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
             Am   D7    Am            D7
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
              Am   D7  Am         D7
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go?
 
             Am   D7    Am            D7
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
              Am   D7  Am         D7
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go?
 
             Am   D7    Am            D7
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
              Am   D7  Am         D7
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go?
 
             Am   D7    Am            D7
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
              Am   D7  Am         D7                 (Am)
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go? 'Cos I love them so.

  And spread our love across this lonely land
               Gm                    Cm7
  We've got to realize, we've got to stop the lies
               EbM7               D7                  Gm
  We've got to love this land and give it a helping hand
               EbM7               D7                  Gm  D 
  We've got to love this land and give it a helping hand

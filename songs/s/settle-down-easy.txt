  F  Am  Gm  C 

[VERSE 1]
F                        Am         Gm  C
  If you need someone to hold on to
F               Am              Gm  C
  I'll help you settle down easy,  (settle down easy)
F               Am             Gm  C
  And when your day is through
F               Am               Gm  C
  I'll help you settle down easy

[PRE-CHORUS 1] (Last chords are played with horns)

  Nothing satisfies me, as much as when you're happy, it's true

[CHORUS 1]
F                         Am  Gm                         C
  Nobody does it like you do,  and I would only tell the truth
               F                             Am                Gm                             C
  You know I'm honest, you look beautiful in blue, but all the colors bring the beauty out in you
                  F        Am                    Gm                    Gm         C
  And when you're running, come run my way, I'll meet you halfway, and love you always
      F     Am                         Gm                  C
  Hey baby, I'll meet you there, ain't nothing compares to you

[VERSE 2] (No uke, just horns, drums, and bass)
-                      -            Am|Gm  -
  If you ever need the weight off you
-               -              Am7|Gm7 -            
  I'll help you settle down easy      (settle down easy)
-               -         Am|Gm  -
  And when our days are few
-               -              Am7|Gm7  -
  I'll help you settle down easy        

[BRIDGE 1] x 2
  F            Am               Gm  C
  La la la, it wasn't by chance
F                  Am                 Gm  C
  A reason that we both crossed paths

       Gm7             Am7          BbM7                   C | F
  That one day I would find you and instantly just fall into

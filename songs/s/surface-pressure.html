Gm                                   F                     Eb
  I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous, I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is
Gm                                 F                     Eb                   D
  I move mountains, I move churches, and I glow 'cause I know what my worth is
Gm                                F                  Eb
  I don't ask how hard the work is, got a rough, indestructible surface
  D
  Diamonds, platinum, I find'em, I flatten'em, I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
Gm                                       F                     Eb
  Under the surface, I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Gm                                F                     Eb
  Under the surface, was Hercules ever like yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus
Gm                                       F                          Eb
  Under the surface, I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
    D
  A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack that breaks the camel's back
       D7
  What breaks the camel's back, it's

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
  Gm                                                Eb      F
  Pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop, whoa
  Gm                                              Bb      F
  Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
  Gm
  Give it to your brother, your brother's older
  Eb
  Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
    Bb                               D
  Who am I if I can't run with the ball, if I fall to

<r->[CHORUS 1B]</r->
  Gm                                                  Eb     F
  Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
  Gm                                                    Bb      F
  Pressure like a tick, tick, tick till it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
  Gm
  Give it to your brother, your brother's stronger
  Eb
  See if he can hang on a little longer
    Bb                          D
  Who am I if I can't carry it all, if I falter

<s->[VERSE 3]</s->
Gm                                           F                    Eb
  Under the surface, I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Gm                                    F                      Eb
  Under the surface, the ship doesn't swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is
Gm                                    F                         Eb
  Under the surface, I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this
       D
  Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows, you try to stop it tumbling, but on and on it goes
 
<s->[VERSE 3]</s->
      Bb               Dm                 Do
  But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight
          Eb                 Ebm6                  Bb             Dm
  Of expectations would that free some room up for - joy, or relaxation?
            Do                   Eb    Ebm6         Gm
  Or simple pleasure, instead we measure this growing pressure
        Dm            Cm           D7
  Keeps growing, keep going, cause all we know is

  Gm                                               Eb      F
  Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
  Gm                                              Bb      F
  Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
  Gm
  Give it to your brother, it doesn't hurt'em
  Eb
  See if he can handle every family burden
  Bb                                      D
  Watch as he buckles and bends but never breaks, no mistakes, just

<r->[CHORUS 2B]</r->
  Gm                                                  Eb     F

  Gm                                                    Bb     F
  Pressure like a tick, tick, tick till it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
  Gm
  Give it to your brother and never wonder
  Eb
  If the same pressure would've pulled you under
  Bb                                D
  Who am I, if I don't have what it takes
                                        Gm
  No cracks, no breaks, no mistakes, no pressure

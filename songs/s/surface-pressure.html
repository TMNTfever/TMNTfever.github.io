<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
Gm                                   F                     Eb
  I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous, I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is
Gm                                 F                     Eb                   D
  I move mountains, I move churches, and I glow 'cause I know what my worth is
Gm                                F                  Eb
  I don't ask how hard the work is, got a rough, indestructible surface
  D
  Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
    D
  I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
Gm                                       F                     Eb
  Under the surface, I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Gm                                F                       Eb
  Under the surface, was Hercules ever like, “Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus”
Gm                                       F                          Eb
  Under the surface, I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
    D
  A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack that breaks the camel's back
       D7
  What breaks the camel's back?

[Chorus 1]
     Gm                                              Eb         F
It's pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop, whoa
Gm                                              Bb        F
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop, whoa-uh-uh
Gm
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Eb
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Bb                               D
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
 
If I fall to
Gm                                                 Eb       F
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Gm                                                  Bb         F
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick till it's ready to blow, whoa-uh-uh
Gm
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
Eb
See if she can hang on a little longer
Bb                           D
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
 
If I falter
 
 
[Verse 2]
Gm
Under the surface
                        F                Eb
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Gm
Under the surface
                 F                      Eb
The ship doesn't swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is
Gm
Under the surface
                 F
I think about my purpose
              Eb
Can I somehow preserve this?
D
Line up the dominoes
D
A light wind blows
D
You try to stop it tumbling
D
But on and on it goes
 
 
[Bridge]
    Bb               Dm                 Do
But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight
        Eb                 Ebm6                  Bb
Of expectations would that free some room up for joy?
        Dm               Do
Or relaxation? Or simple pleasure?
           Eb   Ebm6    Gm
Instead we measure this growing pressure
      Dm             Cm
Keeps growing, keep going
       D7
'Cause all we know is
 
 
[Chorus 2]
Gm                                             Eb         F
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Gm                                              Bb        F
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop, whoa-uh-uh
Gm
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
Eb
See if she can handle every family burden
Bb                                       D
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
N.C.
No mistakes, just
Gm                                                 Eb       F
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Gm                                                  Bb         F
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick till it's ready to blow, whoa-uh-uh
Gm
Give it to your sister and never wonder
Eb
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Bb                                D
Who am I, if I don't have what it takes
                                      Gm
No cracks, no breaks, no mistakes, no pressure

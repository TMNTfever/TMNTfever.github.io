[VERSE 1]
           F             Dm
  When the night has come, and the land is dark
          Bb          C                F
  And the moon is the only light we'll see
       F                     Dm
  No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
          Bb          C               F
  Just as long as you stand, stand by me

  So, darling, darling, stand by me, oh stand by me

  Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

[VERSE 2]

  If the sky that we look upon, should tumble and fall
         Bb              C                F
  Or the mountain should crumble into the sea
            F                    Dm
  I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
          Bb          C               F
  Just as long as you stand, stand by me

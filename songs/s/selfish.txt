G                        Em
  I just don't understand, why you're running from a good man baby
C                                     D
  Why you wanna turn your back on love, why you've already given up
G                                   Em
  See I know you've been hurt before, but I swear I'll give you so much more
C                                F
  I swear I'll never let you down, cause I swear it's you that I adore
        Am7        G/B                  C
  And I can't help myself babe, cause I think about you constantly
         Am7           G/B       C/D      F
  And my heart gets no rest over you, you-you yeah-yeah

  You can call me selfish, but all I want is your love
                      C         D               Em7           G/B
  And you can call me hopeless, baby, cause I'm hopelessly in love
                    C            D                      D#o7            Em7
  You can call me unperfect, but who's perfect, tell me what do I gotta do
     F                               Em7            D               C       G

  I'll be taking up your time, till the day I make you realize
C                                        D
  That for you there could be no one else, I've just gotta have you for myself
G                                   Em
  Baby I would take good care of you, no matter what it is you're going through

  I'll be there for you when you're in need, baby believe in me, cause if love was a crime

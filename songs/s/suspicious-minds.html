<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
G       C              G C C  F            C F
  We're caught in a trap,   I can't walk out
D             C                 G  C G C
  Because I love you too much, baby
G C               G C C            F         C F
  Why can't you see,   what you're doing to me
D                     C             D C Bm D7
  When you don't believe a word I say

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
C             G          Bm                  C  D
  We can't go on together, with suspicious minds
Em                Bm           C               D  D7
  And we can't build our dreams, on suspicious minds

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
G          C               G C C            F       C F
  So if an old friend I know,   drops by to say hello
D                 C           G
  Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
G                  C
  Here we go again, asking where I've been.
D                       C               D      C  Bm  D7
  You can see these tears are real I'm crying.

[Chorus]
C                G        Bm                  C      D7
   We can't go on together, with Suspicious Minds;
Em                  Bm           C              B7sus4   B7
   and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds...

Em             Bm            C
  Oh, let our love survive,
               D
  I'll dry the tears from your eyes.
Em                   Bm             C
  Let's don't let a good thing die,  when honey,
     D                G               C    G       D7
  you know I've never,  lied to you;   Mmm,  yeah,  yeah!

  We're caught in a trap;  I can't walk out

  because I love you too much,  baby.
G                    C
  Why can't you see,   what you're doing to me,
D                      C          G    C  G  C
  when you don't believe a word I say?

  Don't you know...

  I'm caught in a trap;  I can't walk out
D               C               G    C  G  C
  because I love you too much,  baby

<span>[CHORDS]</span>

[Verse 1]
  F                                                                  Gm           C  Gm C
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
    Gm           C                Gm                  C                   F
And if we go someplace to dance I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
 
[Chorus]
    F7                                                      A#           Db
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
    Gm            C               Gm               C              F
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid, like I love you

[Bridge]
      F7                                                                    A#
I can see it in your eyes that you despise The same old lines you heard the night before
    G                                   G7                               C            C7#5
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2]
  F                                                              Gm           C    Gm C
I practice everyday to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
    Gm                C              Gm           C             F
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you

[Chorus]
    F7                                                                      A#              Db
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and oh the night's so blue
    Gm            C               Gm               C7            F
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I love you

[Musical Interlude]
F  Gm  C  Gm  C
Gm  C  Gm  C  F

[Chorus]
    F7                                                                      A#              Db
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and oh the night's so blue
    Gm            C               Gm               C7            F        Db
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I love you

[Outro] x 3
  F        Db
I love you...

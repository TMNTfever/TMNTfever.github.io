  We're caught in a trap,   I can't walk out

  Because I love you too much, baby

  Why can't you see,   what you're doing to me

  So if an old friend I know,   drops by to say hello
D                 C            G        C G C
  Would I still see suspicion in your eyes
G         C      G C C       F             C F
  Here we go again,   asking where I've been
D            C                         D     C       Bm D7
  You can see the tears are real I'm crying (yes I'm crying)

  Lied to you, mmm, yeah yeah

[VERSE 1]
    F               F6             FM7                F6               Gm7           C7 Gm7 C7
  I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
      Gm7          C7               Gm7                 C7                  F             F6 FM7 F6
  And if we go someplace to dance I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[CHORUS 1]
      F                         F7                            Bb           Db6
  And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
      Gm7           C7              Gm7              C7             F     F6 FM7 F6
  And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid, like I love you

[BRIDGE]
        F                               F7                                    Bb           Db6
  I can see it in your eyes that you despise The same old lines you heard the night before
      G                                   G7                               C            C+7
  And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true and never seemed so right before

[VERSE 2]
    F             F6               FM7             F6              Gm7            C7 Gm7 C7
  I practice everyday to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
      Gm7               C7             Gm7          C7            F           F6 FM7 F6
  But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you

[CHORUS 2]
      F                                   F7                                  Bb              Db6
  The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and oh the night's so blue
      Gm7           C7              Gm7              C7            F     F6 FM7 F6
  And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I love you

  The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and oh the night's so blue
      Gm7           C7              Gm7              C7            F        Db6

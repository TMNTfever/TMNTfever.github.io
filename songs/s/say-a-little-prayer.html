  ------------------- I say a little prayer for you
 
<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
F#m7             Bm7   Bm7           E7s4  AM7       D                         C#7
  The moment I wake up, before I put on my makeup, I say a little prayer for you
F#m7                  Bm7   Bm7                 E7s4     AM7         D                         C#7
  While combing my hair now, and wondering what dress to wear now, I say a little prayer for you

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r-> <l->(Bass walkdown at the end)</l->
     D        E7           C#m7          F#m7           G    A
  Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart, and I will love you
     D        E7       C#m7          F#m7  D   F#m G    A
  Forever and ever, we never will part, oh how I   love you
    D         E7             C#m7         F#m7           G   A
  Together, together, that's how it must be, to live without you
        D       E7              C#7
  Would only be heart-break for me (12 11 10 9, 8 #7 6 5)

  I run for the bus dear, while riding I think of us dear, I say a little prayer for you
F#m7                 Bm7       Bm7                 E7s4   AM7          D                         C#7
  And at work I just take time, and all through my coffee breaktime, I say a little prayer for you

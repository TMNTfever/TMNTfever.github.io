[VERSE 1]
          G                         Bm7
  You can offer me a diamond-plated pearl
          Em                            D
  You can send me all the riches in the world
          G                            Bm7
  You can tempt me with the palaces of kings
              Em                D                 G
  I'd give'em back in a big ol' sack and keep the simple things

[CHORUS 1]
             C                           G
  I've got the simple things, I've got the rain in spring
            A                               D
  Got spicy chicken wings, and French-fried onion rings

[VERSE 2]
           G                        Bm7
  You can line me up a mile of limousines
      Em                              D
  For me it don't add up to a hill o' beans
           G                                Bm7
  I got no hankerin' for grabbin' your gold ring
               Em                      D                 G
  It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things

[CHORUS 2]
               C                       G
  I've got the ocean breeze, under the shady trees
                A                        D
  A three-speed standing fan when it's a hundred degrees

[OUTRO]
        G                                  Bm7
  So forgive me for not grabbin' your gold ring

  It's crystal clear, I'll stay right here and keep the simple things

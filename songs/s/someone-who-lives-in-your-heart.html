G-Am-Bm-C (2x)
 
 G              Am                   Bm
Last night, I dreamt that you were beside me
         C          G
It seemed so real that I cried
              Am               Bm
When you touched me, you're my angel
            C        D
And you've given me wings
          C
And I'll fly away with you
  B
Wherever you go
         Em
'Cause you've filled my heart
            A
And you've captured my soul
     C              D
And baby I want you to know
 
 
Chorus:
 
           G                            D
If there's one thing in this world that I know it's true
          Em                            Bm
It's the love that I'm feeling when I'm thinking of you
C                         G        Em
No ocean, no mountain can keep us apart
Am                          D                         G
'Cause no one can take away someone who lives in your heart
G                        D
All of our hopes and our dreams are alive
Em                     Bm
I'll carry you true to distance and time
C                         G        Em
Nothing in this world can keep us apart
Am                   D                         G
No one can take away someone who lives in your heart
 
    G                 Am                Bm
And I know there's a millon stars between us
          C                G        Am
But that won't stop my longing to hold you
        Bm              C   D
And to kiss you, how I love you
          Em                   Em+M7
And I'll find my way to you, wherever you are
          Em7                  A
You're in my soul, baby you've got my heart
       C                D
And your love will carry me home
 
(Repeat Chorus)
 
Bridge:
 
C           B                    Em
Here in my arms is where you should be
                 A
'Cause your loving makes me believe
       C               G
That nothing and no one could tear us apart
       C                 C#
'Cause baby you're in my heart
 
(Repeat Chorus moving chords one fret higher)

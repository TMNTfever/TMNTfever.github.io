[VERSE 1]
  A
  We've been together since way back when, and sometimes I never want to see you again
        D                        E
  But I want you to know, after all these years
       D                            E                E7
  That you're still the one I want whispering in my ears

  You're still the one I like to talk to in bed, still the one that turns my head
       D               E7                       A  D  E7

  Well I look at your face everyday, and I never seen it til it went away
        D                   E
  When winter came, I just wanted to go
  D                         E               E7
  Back to a desert, how I yearned for the snow

  You're still the one that makes me laugh, still the one that's my better half
       D               E7                       A  D  E7
  We're still having fun, and you're still the one

  You're still the one that makes me strong, still the one I wanna take along
       D               E7                       A  D  E7
  We're still having fun, and you're still the one

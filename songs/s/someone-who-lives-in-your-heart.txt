[VERSE 1]
  G             Am                     Bm          C
  Last night, I dreamt that you were beside me, it seemed so real
       G                Am                    Bm                C        D

  And I'll fly away with you wherever you go, cause you've filled my heart and you've capture my soul
      C                  D
  And baby I want you to know

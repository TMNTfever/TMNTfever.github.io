[VERSE 1]
F#m              Bm7   Bm7           E7    AM7
  The moment I wake up, before I put on my makeup
    D                         C#7
  I say a little prayer for you
F#m                   Bm7   Bm7                 E7       AM7
  While combing my hair now, and wondering what dress to wear now
    D                         C#7
  I say a little prayer for you

[CHORUS 1] (Original song does 4/4+7/4, but I do 4/4+6/4)
     D        E7           C#m7          F#m7           -
  Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart, and I will love you
     D        E7       C#m7          F#m7        -
  Forever and ever, we never will part, oh how I love you
    D         E7             C#m7         F#m7           -
  Together, together, that's how it must be, to live without you
        D       E7              C#7
  Would only be heart-break for me (12 11 10 9, 8 #7 6 5)

[VERSE 2]
F#m               Bm7    Bm7             E7       AM7
  I run for the bus dear, while riding I think of us dear
    D                         C#7
  I say a little prayer for you
F#m                  Bm7       Bm7                 E7     AM7

  I say a little prayer for you

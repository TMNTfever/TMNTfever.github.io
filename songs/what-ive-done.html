[INTRO] x 4
  Em  G  D  Am

[Verse]
              Em
  In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi
               G
  There’s no blood
              D
  There’s no alibi
  Am                  Em
  ‘Cause I’ve drawn regret
             G
  From the truth
          D
  Of a thousand lies
  Am           C
  So let mercy come
             D
  And wash away

[Chorus]
             Em
  What I’ve done
        G
  I'll face myself
  D                 Am     Em
  To cross out what I’ve become
    G
  Erase myself
  D               Am      Em
  And let go of what I’ve done

[Verse]
           G
  Put to rest
              D
  What you thought of me
  Am                 Em
  While I clean this slate
            G
  With the hands
         D
  Of uncertainty
  Am           C
  So let mercy come
             D
  And wash away

[Chorus]
 
           Em
What I’ve done
      G
I'll face myself
D                 Am     Em
To cross out what I’ve become
  G
Erase myself
D               Am      Em
And let go of what I’ve done
 

[Solo] x 2
  Em  G  D  Am

[Bridge]
                 Em
  For what I’ve done
        G
  I’ll start again
  D             Am     Em
  And whatever pain may come
    G
  Today this ends
  D              Am
  I’m forgiving what I’ve … 
  Em
  Done
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      G
I'll face myself
D                 Am     Em
To cross out what I’ve become
  G
Erase myself
D               Am      Em
And let go of what I’ve done
Em      G       D       Am       Em    G
                        What I’ve done
D           Am      Em
Forgiving what I’ve done

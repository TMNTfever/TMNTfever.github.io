<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
C            G        Am           F  G7
  Well I remember when we were in love
C            G            Am           F  G7
  Inseperable my baby like a hand and glove
C                 G          Am                 F  G7    
  But things have changed and you're no longer there
C              G               Am                    F  G7
  And all you have to know girl is that I will take care

<span>[CHORUS 1]</span>
Put a little lovin in your heart
Cause that's where love will have to start
Put a little faith in your mind
Cause every little thing will be just fine

<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
And I remember when we hold hands
We take a walk on the beach girl and write our names in the sand
But things have changed and you're no longer there
And all you have to know girl is that I will take care

<span>[CHORUS 2]</span>
Put a little lovin in your heart
Cause that's where love will have to start
Put a little faith in your mind
Cause every little thing will be just fine

<span>[BRIDGE]</span>
You didn't have to leave me without a say and now I'm left here
All alone and I'm still praying

<span>[VERSE 3]</span>
Well I remember when we were in love
Inseperable my baby like a hand and glove
But things have changed and you're no longer there
And all you have to know girl is that I will take care

<span>[CHORUS 3]</span>
Put a little lovin in your heart
Cause that's where love will have to start
Put a little faith in your mind
Cause every little thing will be just fine

<span>[OUTRO]</span>
Love me, love me (won't you love me like I love you)
Love me, love me (well, yeah now)
Love me, love me (alright, yeah baby)
Love me, love me (well yeah, oh baby)
Love me, hey baby

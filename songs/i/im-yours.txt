[VERSE 1]
        B
  Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it
    F#
  I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
    G#m                                    E
  I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back

             B
  Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest
      F#
  and nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
    G#m                           E
  I reckon it's again my turn, to win some or learn some

[CHORUS 1]
      B           F#                G#m             E            B  F#  G#m  E
  But I won't hesitate, no more, no more, it cannot wait, I'm yours

[VERSE 2]
B                                  F#
  Open up your mind and see like me, open up your plans and damn you're free
G#m                                    E
  Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

  B                                                  F#
  Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
G#m                                     E                           C#7
  And it's our god-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

[CHORUS 2]
      B           F#                G#m             E
  But I won't hesitate, no more, no more, it cannot wait, I'm sure
             B             F#                G#m                E
  There's no need to complicate, our time is short, this is our fate, I'm yours

[BRIDGE]
  B                     F#             G#m                          F#
  Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do, doo do, dp you want to come on
               E                                       C#7
  Scooch on over closer dear, and I will nibble your ear
  B  D#m  G#m  F#  E  C#7
  (Scatting)

[VERSE 3]
                     B
  I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
       F#
  Been bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
        G#m                               E
  But my breath fogged up the glass, so I drew a new face and I laughed

    B
  I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
     F#
  To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
     G#m                      E
  It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue

[CHORUS 3]
      B           F#                G#m             E
  But I won't hesitate, no more, no more, it cannot wait, I'm yours

[VERSE 4]
B                                 F#
  Open up your mind and see like me, open up your plans and damn you're free
G#m                                       E
  Look into your heart and you'll find the sky's yours
     B                                                    F#
  So please don't, please don't, please don't, there's no need to complicate
             G#m                                       E            C#7
  Cause our time is short, this-oh this-oh this is our fate, I'm yours

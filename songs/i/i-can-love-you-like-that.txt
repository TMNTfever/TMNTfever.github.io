[VERSE 1]
       C                        Em7
  They read you Cinderella, you hoped it would come true
       F/D                                    F/G
  That one day your Prince Charming would come rescue you
      C                             Em7
  You like romantic movies, and you never will forget
      F/D                          F/G
  The way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet
      Ca9/E                            F/D
  And all this time that you've been waiting
      Ca9/E                   F/D  F6  FM7
  You don't have to wait no more

  So when I say forever, forever's what I mean
        C                      Em7
  Well, I'm no Casanova, but I swear this much is true

  I'll be holdin' nothing back when it comes to you

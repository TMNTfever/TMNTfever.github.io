[VERSE 1]
      C                           Em             F                             Fm6
  And now that we've reached the end, I think of all that's passed, of how the time that went so fast
         C                   Em            F                                G  G#o7
  And of how I've come to depend, upon the faith I feel inside your guiding hands

[PRE-CHORUS 1]
Am            AmM7                        GM7
  Say you'll go with me forever, though I know that you can't
         Am                                             AmM7
  Well I ain't much with words, there's nothin' I could say that you ain't heard
        F                               G
  But I promise you that each and every day

[CHORUS 1]
C                 Am             F                             G
  I'll hear your voice, in every thought that flows through my mind
C                Am           F                            G  G#o7
  I'll see your face in every cloud that floats through my sky
  Am                         AmM7                         C                   Fm6  G#o7
  And when the world is too much, and the hurt's got me down on my knees to pray
C                 Am                   F    G    C
  I'll hear your voice, and you won't be so far away

[VERSE 2]
           C                  Em              F                               Fm6
  Do you remember a moonless night, with only sound for a view, funny what an ocean can do
         C                          Em                F                               G  G#o7
  It was then that we knew this was right, and in our arms we would've shared so many nights

[PRE-CHORUS 2]
Am            AmM7                              GM7
  Say you'll go with me wherever, even though I know it's just a dream
           Am                                       AmM7
  Though I know it's unknown, it's something that I gotta do alone
        F                                 G
  But I swear to you, I could never do anything without your soul inside

C                Am           F                            G  G#o7
  I'll see your face in every cloud that floats through my sky
  Am                         AmM7                         C                   Fm6  G#o7
  And when the world is too much, and the hurt's got me down on my knees to pray
C                 Am                   F    G    C
  I'll hear your voice, and you won't be so far away

[BRIDGE]
               A#                       Am7
  Someday I'll hold you, and we will be sailin'

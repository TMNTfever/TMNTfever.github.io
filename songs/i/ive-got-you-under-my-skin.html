[VERSE 1]
       Em7    A7        DM7  Bm7
  I've got you under my skin
       Em7    A7            DM7      Bm7
  I've got you deep in the heart of me
         Em7             A7                DM7     Bm7
  And so deep in my heart you're nearly a part of me
       Em7    A7        DM7  D6
  I've got you under my skin

[VERSE 2]
       Em7     A7           DM7  Bm7
  I've tried so not to give in
    Em7b5                  A7b9            DM7   D6
  I said to myself, this affair never can go so well
      C#m7                  F#7                  BM7      Bm7     ???????????????
  But why should I try to resist, when darling I know so well
       Em7    A7        DM7  D6
  I've got you under my skin

[Chorus]
     A6                  A7
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might, 
         D      Gdim        D7
For the sake of having you near,
    Bm7           G                 Gm
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night 
         D         Cdim         A7
That repeats and repeats in my ear,
            Bm                G     A7        D
Don't you know, little fool,  you never can win?
Fdim         Em7     G/B      A7       D         A+
Use your mentality  -    wake up to reality
     D          G               Gm
But each time I do, just the thought of you
          D     Am       B7
Makes me stop before I begin -

(NC)      Em7      A7-9          D      Bm7
'Cause I've got you      under my skin,
     Em7     G/B A7       D     Gdim    D
I've got you    under my skin

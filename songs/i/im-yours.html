        B
  Well, you done done me in; you bet I felt it
    F#
  I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
    G#m                                    E
  I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back
 
             B
  Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin' it my bestest
      F#
  and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
    G#m                           E
  I reckon it's again my turn, to win some or learn some
 
<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
      B           F#                G#m
  But I won't hesitate, no more, no more
            E            B  F#  G#m  E
  It cannot wait, I'm yours
 
<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
B                                      F#
  Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                   G#m
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                     E
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
 
B                                               F#                               G#m
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
                                      E                           C#7
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
 
<r->[CHORUS 2]</r->
  (Same as Chorus 1, except go straight into Bridge)
 
<b->[BRIDGE]</b->
B                     F#            G#m
Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do doo do
                       F#              E
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                       C#7
And I will nibble your ear
 
 B  D#m  G#m F#  E      C#7   
 
[Verse 3]
                   B
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    F#
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    G#m
But my breath fogged up the glass
         E
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
  B
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   F#
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
   G#m
It's what we aim to do
    E
Our name is our virtue
 
[Chorus]
    B           F# F#sus4
But I won't hesitate
            G#m
No more, no more
          E            B
It cannot wait; I'm yours
                                     F#
Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                    G#m
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                         E
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
   B
So please don't, please don't, please don't
           F#       F#sus4
There's no need to complicate
           G#m
'Cause our time is short
                              E
This oh, this oh, this is our fate
       C#7
I'm yours
 
[Outro]
N.C.                   B
Brr-ba-mmm, da-ba-mmm-day
                                 F#
T-du, du, t-du, du, t-du, dudu, du-u, du-du
G#m      E
     Oh, I'm yours
        B
Oh, I'm yours
                     F#
Oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
                       G#m
Baby, do believe I'm yours
                                        E
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours

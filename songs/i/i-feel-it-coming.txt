[INTRO]
  Em  Am  F  C
  Em  Am  F  C

[VERSE 1]
                         Em
Tell me what you really like
                     Am
Baby, I can take my time
                       F
We don't ever have to fight
                       C
Just take it step-by-step
                     Em
I can see it in your eyes
                           Am
'Cause they never tell me lies
                       F
I can feel that body shake
                           C
And the heat between your legs

[PRE-CHORUS 1]
                       Am
You've been scared of love
             Em
And what it did to you
                   Dm
You don't have to run
                 C
I know what you've been through
               Am
Just a simple touch
            Em
And it can set you free
                  Dm
We don't have to rush
                   C
When you're alone with me

[CHORUS 1]
             Em
I feel it coming
             Am
I feel it coming, babe
             F
I feel it coming
             C
I feel it coming, babe

[VERSE 2]
                        Em
You are not the single type
                           Am
So baby, this the perfect time
                            F
I'm just trying to get you high
                    C
And faded off this touch
                         Em
You don't need a lonely night
                        Am
So baby, I can make it right
                         F
You just got to let me try
                      C
To give you what you want

[PRE-CHORUS 2]
                       Am
You've been scared of love
             Em
And what it did to you
                   Dm
You don't have to run
                 C
I know what you've been through
               Am
Just a simple touch
            Em
And it can set you free
                  Dm
We don't have to rush
                   C
When you're alone with me

[CHORUS 2]
             Em
I feel it coming
             Am
I feel it coming babe
             F
I feel it coming
             C
I feel it coming babe

[PRE-CHORUS 2]
                       Am
You've been scared of love
             Em
And what it did to you
                   Dm
You don't have to run
                 C
I know what you've been through
               Am
Just a simple touch
            Em
And it can set you free
                  Dm
We don't have to rush
                   C
When you're alone with me

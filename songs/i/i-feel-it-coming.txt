[VERSE 1]
C                          Em                       Am
  Tell me what you really like, baby I can take my time
                         F                          C
  We don't ever have to fight, just take it step-by-step
                        Em                              Am
  I can see it in your eyes, 'cause they never tell me lies
                       F                                C
  I can feel that body shake, and the heat between your legs

[PRE-CHORUS 1]
                        Am                Em
  You've been scared of love and what it did to you
                    Dm                      C
  You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
                Am                    Em
  Just a simple touch, and it can set you free
                   Dm                     C
  We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

[CHORUS 1] x 2
             G                 Am                     F                 C          -
  I feel it coming, I feel it coming babe, I feel it coming, I feel it coming babe

[VERSE 2]
                          Em                             Am
  You are not the single type, so baby this the perfect time
                              F                       C
  I'm just trying to get you high, and faded off this touch
                           Em                           Am
  You don't need a lonely night, so baby I can make it right
                           F                       C
  You just got to let me try, to give you what you want

                Am                    Em
  Just a simple touch, and it can set you free

  We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

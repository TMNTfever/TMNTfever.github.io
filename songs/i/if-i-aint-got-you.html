GM7         Bm7           Em
Some people live for the fortune
Am                             D
Some people live just for the fame
GM7         Bm7            Em
Some people live for the power yeah
Am                                D
Some people live just to play the game
GM7         Am             Bm7       Am
Some people think that the physical things
GM7    Am        Bm7
Define what's within
Am       GM7          Am
And I've been there before
Bm7               Am
But that life's a bore
   GM7          Am     Bm7
So full of the superficial


CHORUS:
GM7   Am Bm7 CM7
Some  people want it all
CM7              Bm7
But I don't want nothing at all
            Am
If it ain't you baby
                GM7  
If I ain't got you baby
GM7   Am Bm  CM7
Some  people want diamond rings
CM7            Bm7
Some just want everything
                      Am
But everything means nothing
                GM7  
If I ain't got you


GM7         Bm7           Em
Some people search for a fountain
Am                   D
The promises forever young
GM7         Bm7        Em
Some people need three dozen roses
Am                                   D
And that's the only way to prove you love them
GM7       Am         Bm7       Am
Hand me a world on a silver platter
    GM7       Am       Bm7   Am
And what good would it be?
     GM7        Am         Bm7        Am    GM7   Am   Bm7
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me


(CHORUS)x2


If I ain't got you with me baby
Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby

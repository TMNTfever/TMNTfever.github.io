[VERSE 1]
       G                 GM7                G7                 C
  If a picture paints a thousand words then why can't I paint you?
      Cm               G        Cm6              D7
  The words will never show the you I've come to know
       G                    GM7                G7             C
  If a face could launch a thousand ships then where am I to go?
           Cm              G           Cm6                D7
  There's no one home but you, you're all that's left me to

[CHORUS 1]
      Em      D#+      G               GMb5
  And when my love for life is running dry
      Dm6      E7       Am7     D7
  You come and pour yourself on me

[VERSE 2]
       G                 GM7           G7               C
  If a man could be two places at one time I'd be with you
     Cm           G     Cm6              D7
  Tomorrow and today beside you all the way
         G                    GM7               G7             C
  If the world should stop revolving, spinning slowly down to die
      Cm                  G       Cm6                D7
  I'd spend the end with you and when the world was through

[CHORUS 2]
       Em     D#+     G                  GMb5
  Then one by one the stars would all go out
       Dm6     E7      Am7    D7   G  C  Cm6  G
  Then you and I would simply fly away

[VERSE 1]
       Em7    A7        DM7  Bm7
  I've got you under my skin
       Em7    A7            DM7      Bm7
  I've got you deep in the heart of me
         Em7             A7                DM7     Bm7
  And so deep in my heart you're nearly a part of me
       Em7    A7        DM7  D6
  I've got you under my skin

[VERSE 2]
       Em7     A7           DM7  Bm7
  I've tried so not to give in
    Em7b5                  A7             DM7       D6
  I said to myself, this affair never can go so well
      C#m7                  F#7                  B6
  But why should I try to resist, when darling I know so well
       Em7    A7        DM7  D6
  I've got you under my skin

[BRIDGE]
      Em7                 A7
  I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
           DM7               D7       B7
  For the sake of having you near, in spite of the
  Em7                A7
  Warning voice that comes in the night
         F#m7        F#o7        D7
  That repeats and repeats in my ear
              Bm7            Em7    A7       DM7  D6
  Don't you know, little fool, you never can win
  F#m7        F#o7    Em7    A7    DM7  Am7  B7
  Use your mentality, wake up to reality

[CHORUS]
           G6                  Gm6
  But each time I do, just the thought of you
           D6            F#m7b5  B7
  Makes me stop before I begin
             Em7    A7        DM7  D6
  Cause I've got you under my skin
       Em7    A7        DM7
  I've got you under my skin

[VERSE 1]
C E7            Am7      F C    E7           Am7   F
  You and me we made a vow, for better or for worse
C   E7                Am7       F              C            F/G      C
  I can't believe you let me down, but the proof's in the way it hurts
C     E7                 Am7         F C  E7         Am7  F
  For months on end I've had my doubts, denying every tear
C   E7                 Am7     F          C              F/G         C
  I wish this would be over now, but I know that I still need you here

      C E7      Am7 Fa9    C                 E7                 Am7 Fa9
  You say I'm crazy, cause you don't think I know what you've done
      C E7     Am7  G  Fa9     C                F/G  C   Fa9
  But when you call me baby, I know I'm not the only one

[VERSE 2]
C        E7         Am7    F C    E7           Am7 F
  You've been so unavailable, now sadly I know why
C      E7           Am7    F           C          F/G           C
  Your heart is unobtainable, even though Lord knows you have mine

      C E7      Am7 Fa9    C                 E7                 Am7 Fa9
  You say I'm crazy, cause you don't think I know what you've done
      C E7     Am7  G  Fa9     C                F/G  C   Fa9
  But when you call me baby, I know I'm not the only one

[BRIDGE]
F                        C         E7                   Am7  G
  I have loved you for many years, maybe I am just not enough
F                              C             F/G
  You've made me realise my deepest fear, by lying and tearing us up

  You say I'm crazy, cause you don't think I know what you've done
      C E7     Am7  G  Fa9     C                F/G  C   Fa9
  But when you call me baby, I know I'm not the only one

  C  Em7  F/2  F/5       C  Em7  F/2  F | G7s2
  ---------------- Yeah ooh

<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
       C                        Em7
  They read you Cinderella, you hoped it would come true
       F/2                                    F/5
  That one day your Prince Charming would come rescue you
      C                             Em7
  You like romantic movies, and you never will forget
      F/2                          F/5
  The way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet
      Ca9/3                            F/2
  And all this time that you've been waiting
      Ca9/3                   F/2  F/5
  You don't have to wait no more

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
-                         Ca9                       Em7
  I can love you like that, I would make you my world

  Move heaven and earth, if you were my girl
  I will give you my heart, be all that you need
  Show you you're everything that's precious to me
  If you give me a chance, I can love you like that
  I can love you like that

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
I never make a promise I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever, forever's what I mean
Well, I'm no Casanova, but I swear this much is true
I'll be holdin' nothing back when it comes to you
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well, baby open up your eyes

<r->[CHORUS 2]</r->
, yeah

<b->[BRIDGE]</b->
If you want tenderness, I got tenderness
And I see through to the heart of you
If you want a man, who understands
You don't have to look very far
I can love you, girl oh yeah, I can love you

<r->[CHORUS 3]</r->

<s->[OUTRO]</s->
If I could love you, we'd kiss in heaven
Baby be mine, my one and only girl
My heart, my heart, my world
Oh, you're everything to me
I can love you like that

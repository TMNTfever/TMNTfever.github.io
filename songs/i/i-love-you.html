{verse 1}
There is something that i need to say
Right before i start my day
Girl you know i love you and i always will be good to you
And i can't lie, girl you know i won't deny
All the things that i have put us through
And you know i, i'd do anything for you
All you really need to know is that i'm true
Listen, i'm still in love with you, girl

If you believe me, please don't hesitate
Let me show you i can make you happy
Girl, i love you, i appreciate
Each and every little thing you do for me
Please hold me, baby once again
I don't wanna have to live without you
You complete me, let me be your man
All i wanna do is show you
That i love you, i love you

Oh if you could only see
Just how much you mean to me
You would never walk away
Each and every night i pray
And i thank the lord above
Every day for your precious love
Girl, i love you x2

(c'mon)
Obviously girl, you're everything to me
I'd never do anything to hurt you, see
I love you with all my heart and soul
More than anything in this crazy world
The truth is there's nowhere i'd rather be
Than with you, girl, i'll love you for eternity
So baby, please believe me when i say
That i love you and i'll always feel this way


{chorus x2}
If you believe me, please don't hesitate (woah)
Let me show you i can make you happy
Girl, i love you, i appreciate
Each and every little thing you do for me (woah)
Please hold me, baby once again
I don't wanna have to live without you

You complete me, let me be your man
All i wanna do is show you

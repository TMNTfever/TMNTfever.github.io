[VERSE 1] (Slow on first half)
         GM7                        G7        G6              CM7
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go
         Am7                       GM7
  Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again
       Am7                           D7
  With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

         G                                                   C
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, toys in every store
          D                              E
  But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be
          D7        G
  On your own front door

[CHORUS 1] (Whole notes while drums solo)
            B7                                               Em7
  A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots, is the wish of Barney and Ben
  A7                                                Bm7
  Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk, is the hope for Janice and Jen
      D7                              G7
  And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[VERSE 2]
         G                                                    C
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go
                Am7                      GM7
  Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
      Am7                               D7
  The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

         G                                                         C
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, soon the bells will start
           D                                      E
   And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
            D7       G
  Right within, your heart

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1, except end slowly)
            B7                                               Em7
  A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots, is the wish of Barney and Ben
  A7                                                Bm7
  Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk, is the hope for Janice and Jen
      D7                              G7
  And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, soon the bells will start
          D                                      E
  And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
           Am7 D7   G#o7
  Right within your heart
            Am7       D7   G
  Sure it's Christmas once more

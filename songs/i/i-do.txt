  It's always been about me, myself, and I
Gm7                         C
  If all relationships were nothing but a waste of time
F                      Bb
  I never wanted to be anybody's other half
Gm7                    C
  Always happy staying out of love that wouldn't last

  That was the only way I knew 'til I met you

  You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games

  I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down
Gm7                        C

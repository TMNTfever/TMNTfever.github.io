  G               Bm7                    C           D            G
  Time, I've been passing time, watching trains go by, all of my life
        Bm7                  C           A7        G
  Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly, wishing there could be
B7                Em           A7                Am7                     D
  Someone waiting home for me, yeah, something's telling me it might be you
            Am7                     D              G
  Yeah it's telling me it might be you, all of my life

[VERSE 2]
          Bm7                 C         D            G
  Looking back as lovers go walking past, all of my life
            Bm7                   C            A7     G
  Wondering how they met and what makes it last, if I found the place
B7             Em             A7                Am7                     D
  Would I recognize the face, yeah, something's telling me it might be you
           Am7                     D              Em
  And it's telling me it might be you, all of my life

[BRIDGE]
          Bm7             D    Dm                 C
  So many quiet walks to take, so many dreams to wake
              Cm7              G       D
  And there's so much love to make, mmhmm
Em              A7               D          Dm              CM7 E7
  I think we're gonna need some time, maybe all we need is time
           Am7                     D              G
  And it's telling me it might be you, all of my life

[VERSE 3]
            Bm7                   C        A7            G
  I've been saving love songs and lullabies, and there's so much more
B7              Em         A7
  No one's ever heard before
              Am7                     D             Am7                    D
  Something's telling me it might be you, yeah it's telling me it must be you
          Am7                    D              G
  And I'm feeling it'll just be you, all of my life

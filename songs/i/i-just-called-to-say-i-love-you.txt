  C

[VERSE 1]
                C           C                    C                              Dm
  No New Year`s day, to celebrate, no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
              Dm                 Dm                     G                     C
  No first of spring, no song to sing, in fact here`s just another ordinary day

           C                C                  C                             Dm
  No April rain, no flowers bloom, no wedding Saturday within the month of June
              Dm               Dm                 G                                   C
  But what it is, is something true, made up of these three words that I must say to you

[CHORUS 1]
             Dm      G     C     C            Dm      G              Am  Am
  I just called to say I love you, I just called to say how much I care
            Dm       G     Am    Am       Dm               G           C
  I just called to say I love you, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[VERSE 2]
              C               C                 C                            Dm
  No summer`s high, no warm July, no harvest moon to light one tender August night
              Dm               Dm                G                                  C
  No autumn breeze, no falling leaves, not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

           C            C                   C                                  Dm
  No Libra Sun, no Halloween, no giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
              Dm                Dm                   G                                  C
  But what it is, though old-so-new, to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

[CHORUS 2]
             D#m     G#    C#    C#           D#m     G#             A#m  A#m
  I just called to say I love you, I just called to say how much I care
            D#m      G#    A#m   A#m      D#m              G#          C#
  I just called to say I love you, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[CHORUS 3]
             Em      A     D     D            Em      A              Bm  Bm
  I just called to say I love you, I just called to say how much I care
            Em       A     Bm    Bm       Em               A           D
  I just called to say I love you, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[OUTRO]
  A#    C            D
  Of my heart, of my heart

[VERSE 1]
Em              C  Am                   Em  B
  Telling me to go, but hands beg me to stay
Em                       C          Am                Em  B
  Your lips say that you love, your eyes say that you hate
          Em                  C
  There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
  Am                 Em     B
  What you build you lay to waste
          Em                  C
  There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
  Am                  Em          B
  All I've got's what you didn't take

[CHORUS 1]
     Am                C                  G             D
  So I, I won't be the one, be the one to leave this in pieces
      Am               C                          G           D
  And you, you will be alone, alone with all your secrets and regrets
        Em  Am    Em  Am    Em  Am    Em  B
  Don't lie

[VERSE 2]
Em                   C   Am                   Em  B
  You promise me the sky, then toss me like a stone
Em                    C    Am                   Em  B
  You wrap me in your arms, and chill me to the bone
          Em                  C
  There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
  Am                  Em          B
  All I've got's what you didn't take

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1, except don't play chords after, "Don't lie")
     Am                C                  G             D
  So I, I won't be the one, be the one to leave this in pieces
      Am               C                          G           D             (Em)
  And you, you will be alone, alone with all your secrets and regrets, dont lie

[CHORUS 3] (Same as Chorus 1)
     Am                C                  G             D
  So I, I won't be the one, be the one to leave this in pieces
      Am               C                          G           D
  And you, you will be alone, alone with all your secrets and regrets
        Em  Am    Em  Am    Em  Am    Em  B
  Don't lie

  And the children sing as the church bells ring everywhere
G
  Everyone's about the peace on Earth
Bm7
  A little Christmassing for what it's worth
           Em
  And the whole world smiles
           D                C  D
  There′s only love in the air
  C                  Cm           D
  Snow fall faster, go get santa now

  And my mistletoe is hanging in the hope of a kiss

  Snow fall faster, go get santa now

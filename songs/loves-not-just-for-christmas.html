[VERSE 1]
G
  I filled your stocking to the very top
Bm7
  Put your coffee in a Christmas cup
           Em                   D                      C   D
  And the children sing as the church bells ring everywhere
G
  Everyone's about the peace on Earth
Bm7
  A little Christmassing for what it's worth
           Em
  And the whole world smiles
           D                C  D
  There′s only love in the air
  C                  Cm           D
  Snow fall faster, go get santa now


[CHORUS 1]
  G
  Christmas, wrap it and send it
  B7
  Christmas, however you spend it
  Em             G             GMb5  D
  Make December last forever, whoa!
  G
  Christmas, love one another
  B7
  Christmas, a spell that we're under
  Em             G             GMb5
  Make December last forever, whoa!
        D                   G
  Cause love′s not just for Christmas


[VERSE 2]
G
  I put a lot of tinsel on the tree
Bm7
  Bought a turkey and some brandy cream
          Em           Dm                       C   D
  And my mistletoe is hanging in the hope of a kiss
  C                  Cm           D
  Snow fall faster, go get santa now


[CHORUS 2]

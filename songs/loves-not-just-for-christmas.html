  I filled your stocking to the very top

  Put your coffee in a Christmas cup
           Em                   D                      C   D
  And the children sing as the church bells ring everywhere
G
  Everyone's about the peace on Earth
Bm7
  A little Christmassing for what it's worth
           Em
  And the whole world smiles
           D                C  D
  There′s only love in the air
  C                  Cm           D
  Snow fall faster, go get santa now

  Christmas, a spell that we're under

  Cause love′s not just for Christmas

  Bought a turkey and some brandy cream
          Em           Dm                       C   D
  And my mistletoe is hanging in the hope of a kiss

  Snow fall faster, go get santa now

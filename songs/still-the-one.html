<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
C
We've been together since way back when, and 

sometimes I never want to see you again
      F           G7
But I want you to know, after all these years
 F                      G7
That you're still the one I want whispering in my ears.

<span>[CHORUS 1]</span>
C                     F
You're still the one I like to talk to in bed, 
Am               D7
Still the one that turns my head
 F                G7            C     F  G7
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
C
Well I look at your face everyday, 

and I never seen it til it went away
  F           G7
When winter came, I just wanted to go,
F             G7
Back to a desert, how I yearned for the snow

<span>[CHORUS 2]</span>
    C               F
You're still the one that makes me laugh, 
Am               D7
Still the one that's my better half
  F               G7            C    F   G7
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
     C            F
You're still the one that makes me strong, 
Am                D7
Still the one I wanna take along
  F               G7            C    F   G7
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

   C                F
You're still the one that I love to touch, 
Am                     D7
Still the one, and I can't get enough
  F                G7          C
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
 F / G7 / C            F
You are still the one who can scratch my itch, 
Am                D7
Still the one, and I wouldn't switch

Still the one that I dream about

We're still having fun, and you're still the one
  F                G7               C    F    G7
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

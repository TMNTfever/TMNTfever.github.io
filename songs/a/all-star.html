<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
      G         D              Am          C          G                  D             Am  C
  Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
          G             D               Am           C                G          D           Am     C
  She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb, in the shape of an "L" on her forehead
           G                           D                  Am                     C
  Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming, fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
  G                        D                  Am                        C
  Didn't make sense not to live for fun, your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

<r->[REFRAIN 1]</r->
  G                   D                      Am                 C
  So much to do so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets
         G                       D          Am                       C
  You'll never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't glow

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
  G                  C                  C#o       C
  Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
  G                C                  C#o       C
  Hey now, you're a rockstar, get the show on get paid
      G        C             C#o C             G     F           C
  And all that glitters is gold, only shooting stars break the mold

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
         G                   D                          Am                 C
  It's a cool place and they say it gets colder, you're bundled up now but wait to get older
      G                 D                      Am                    C
  The meteor men beg to differ, judging by the hole in the satellite picture
             G                       D                        Am                        C
  The ice we skate is getting pretty thin, the waters getting warm so you might as well swim
                G                  D                   Am                      C
  My world's on fire how about yours, that's the way I like it and I never get bored

  Somebody once asked, could I spare some change for gas, I need to get myself away from this place
         G             D              Am                 C                  G         D        Am   -
  I said yep what a concept, I could use a little fuel myself, and we could all use a little change
           G                           D                  Am                     C

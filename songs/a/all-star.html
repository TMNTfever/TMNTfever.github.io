<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
      G         D              Am          C          G                  D             Am  C
  Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
          G             D               Am           C                G          D           Am     C
  She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb, in the shape of an "L" on her forehead

           G                           D                  Am                     C
  Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming, fed to the rules and I hit the ground running 
  G                        D                  Am                        C
  Didn't make sense not to live for fun, your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb 

<r->[REFRAIN 1]</r->
  G                   D                      Am                 C
  So much to do so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets
         G                       D          Am                       C
  You'll never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't glow

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
  G                  C                  C#o       C
  Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play 
  G                C                  C#o       C
  Hey now, you're a rockstar, get the show on get paid 
      G        C             C#o C             G     F           C
  And all that glitters is gold, only shooting stars break the mold 

<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
       G                   D
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder 
       Am                       C
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older 
        G                 D
But the meteor men beg to differ 
               Am                    C
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture 
 
           G                       D
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin 
                   Am                        C
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim 
              G              D
My world's on fire how about yours 
                 Am                      C
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

    G         D              Am                    C
Somebody once asked, could I spare some change for gas 
          G           D             Am    C
I need to get myself away from this place
       G             D            Am                  C
I said yep what a concept I could use a little fuel myself 
             G         D      Am       C
And we could all use a little change 
 
         G                           D
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming 
Am                     C
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running 
G                        D
Didn't make sense not to live for fun 
     Am                        C
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

Only shooting stars break the mold

  A
  I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick

  All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
C#7                           F#m
  And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
Dm7                       A             F#7
  And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
  Bm7
  Santa won't you bring me the one I really need

  Won't you please bring my baby to me

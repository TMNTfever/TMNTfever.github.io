[VERSE 1]
Em             C                     G
  What would I do without your smart mouth
             D                        Em
  Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
         C              G             D             Em
  Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
               C                     G
  What's going on in that beautiful mind
              D                 Em
  I'm on your magical mystery ride
          C               G                     D           Am
  And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[REFRAIN 1] (Am 1-2-3-5 arpeggio)
     Am            G         D              Am
  My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
  Am                G              D
  You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[CHORUS 1] (G 5-3-1 arpeggio)
        G               Em
  Cause all of me loves all of you
            Am                                  C              D
  Love your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections
            G                       Em
  Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
            Am                         C                 D
  You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose I'm winning
                   Em C   G  D
  Cause I give you all of me
                  Em C   G        D              D                Am
  And you give me all of you, (1:oh) (2: give me all of you, oh oh yeah)

[VERSE 2]
Em         C                       G
  How many times do I have to tell you
                   D                         Em
  Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
               C             G           D                   Em
  The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
               C                 G
  You're my downfall, you're my muse
                D                        Em
  My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
                C             G            D           Am
  I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

[REFRAIN 2] (Same as Refrain 1)
     Am            G         D              Am

  Am                G              D
  You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

  Love your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections
            G                       Em
  Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
            Am                         C                 D
  You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose I'm winning
                   Em C   G  D
  Cause I give you all of me
                  Em C   G            D              Am
  And you give me all of you, give me all of you, oh yeah

[BRIDGE]
  Am           G            D              Am
  Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
  Am           G                D
  Risking it all, though it's hard

[CHORUS 3] (Same as Chorus 1, but repeat last two lines)

  Love your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections
            G                       Em
  Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
            Am                         C                 D
  You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose I'm winning
                   Em C   G  D                Em C   G         D

[VERSE 1]
A                                  Bm7
  Used to spend my nights at a bar room
Bm7                                 A
  Liquor was the only love I've known
A                                               Bm7
  But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
Bm7                                        A
  And brought me back from being too far gone

[CHORUS 1]
            A                          Bm7
  You're as smooth, as Tennessee whiskey
            Bm7                   A  D | A
  You're as sweet as strawberry wine
            A                       Bm7
  You're as warm as a glass of brandy
                   Bm7                           A  D | A
  And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

[VERSE 2]
A                                             Bm7
  Iâ€™ve looked for love in all the same old places
Bm7                                          A  D | A
  Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry
A                                                   Bm7
  But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
                Bm7                              A
  Cause there nothing like your love to get me high, and

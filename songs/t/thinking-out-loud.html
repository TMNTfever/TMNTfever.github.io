  When your legs don't work like they used to before

C C/E                                F              G
  Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love

  People fall in love in mysterious ways, maybe just the touch of a hand
       Dm                           G           Am
  Well me, I fall in love with you every single day

F G                          C C/E
  Take me into your loving arms
F G                            C        C/E
  Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
F G                                 C C/E
  Place your head on my beating heart
               F   G           Am G     F    C/E   Dm    G  C
  I'm thinking out loud, maybe we found love right where we are

<s->[VERSE 2A]</s->
C C/E                                F           G
  When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
C C/E                              F   G
  And the crowds don't remember my name
C C/E                 F                    G
  When my hands don't play the strings the same way
C C/E                               F   G
  I know you will still love me the same

                 C C/E                 F G                C C/E F G
  Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
              C C/E              F    G            C C/E F            G

  People fall in love in mysterious ways, and maybe it's all part of a plan
       Dm                            G      Am
  Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
  Dm                        G                C C/E
  Hoping that you'll understand, that baby now

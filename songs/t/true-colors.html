             C#m7 B    E           A              C#m7   B
You with the sad eyes, don't be discouraged, oh I realize
     E               A         C#m7             B    E                  A
It's hard to take courage in a world full of people, you can lose sight of it all
    C#m             B                A       E
The darkness inside you can make you feel so small

          C#m        B/D#
Show me a smile then
E           A             C#m
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
 B      E              A
When I last saw you laughing
         C#m            B
If this world makes you crazy
            E            A
And you've taken all you can bear
 C#m          B
Just call me up
              A         E
'Cause I will always be there
 
[Chorus]
 
               A    E
And I see your true colors
B
Shining through
           A    E
I see your true colors
     A             B
And that's why I love you
   A           E      G#        C#m
So don't be afraid to let them show
     A    E
Your true colors
A    E           Bsus4    B
True colors are beautiful
 
               A    E
I see your true colors
B
Shining through
           A    E
I see your true colors
     A             B
And that's why I love you
   A           E      G#        C#m
So don't be afraid to let them show
     A    E
Your true colors
A    E           Bsus4    B
True colors are beautiful
       C#m     B E A
Like a rainbow

Ooohh.... like a rainbow

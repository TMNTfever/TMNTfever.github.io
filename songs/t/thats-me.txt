[VERSE 1]
G                                     Bm7           Am7    D
  You've been hurt before and you've cried, causing rainy days
G                         Bm7           Am7   D
  Give me the chance and I'll take that pain away
Em                                        Bm7
  Cause' when you're feeling down, you'd make a blue sky cry
  Am7                                         D
  Please my darling don't be sad, there'll be no more goodbyes

  Let me be your shining light when the darkness comes along your way
G                                      Bm7                               Am7          D
  I will be that shooting star, in the cold black night you look to and pray, and you say
           Em                                   Bm7
  That you want a man who's always there, who's faithful til the very end
      Am7                                    D

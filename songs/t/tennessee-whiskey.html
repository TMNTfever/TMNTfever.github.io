A  Bm7
 
A                            Bm7
Used to spend my nights at a barroom
                              A    D   A
Liquor was the only love I've known
A                                        Bm7
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
                                       A    D   A
And brought me back from being too far gone
 
 
[Chorus]
A                                  Bm7
You're as smooooooth, as Tennessee whiskey
                                   A    D   A
You're as sweeeeeeet as strawberry wine
A                                  Bm7
You're as waaaarrrrm as a glass of brandy
                                             A    D   A
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time
 
 
[Verse 2]
A                                        Bm7
Iâ€™ve looked for love in all the same old places
                                        A    D   A
Found the bottom of the bottle's always drrryyy
A                                           Bm7
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
                                             A
Cause there nothing like your love to get me hiiiiigggh. You're as
 
 
[Chorus]
A                        Bm7
Smooooooth, as Tennessee whiskey
                                   A    D   A
You're as sweeeeeeet as strawberry wine
A                                  Bm7
You're as waaaarrrrm as a glass of brandy
                                             A    D   A
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

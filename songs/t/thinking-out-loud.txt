C C/E                                F           G
  When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
C C/E                              F   G
  And the crowds don't remember my name
C C/E                 F                    G
  When my hands don't play the strings the same way

  I know you will still love me the same

  People fall in love in mysterious ways, and maybe it's all part of a plan
       Dm             Dm/F           G      Am
  Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
  Dm          Dm/F          G                C C/E
  Hoping that you'll understand, that baby now

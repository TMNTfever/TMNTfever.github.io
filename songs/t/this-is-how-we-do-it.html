  This is how we do it, (this is how we do it) lalalalala la la

  This is how we do it, it's Friday night, and I feel all right, the party's here on the Westside
       Fm                                -                          Gb
  So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up, designated driver take the keys to my truck
Fm                                -                         Gb
  Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded, honeys in the street say- Monty yo we made it

Fm7                      -       Gb        Fm7
  It feels so good in my hood tonight, the summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
  -                       Gb                  Fm7                                -               Gm7
  All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by, you gotta get your groove on before you go get paid
     Fm7                                          -                     Gb
  So tip up your cup and throw your hands up, and let me hear the party say

      Fm7                                -              Gb
  I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (this is how we do it) 
          Fm7                             -              Gb
  South Central does it like nobody does (this is how we do it)
       Fm7                                 -              Gb
  To all my neighbors you got much flavor (this is how we do it)
       Fm7                                         -              Gb  
  Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)
 
<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G. The girls see I got the money
A hundred-dollar bills y'all
 
Fm7                                             Gb
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
       Fm7
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
                        Gb
You can get yours in a '64
Fm7                               Gb
Whatever it is, the party's underway
   Fm7
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
                          Gb
And let me hear the party say

Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6'8" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and OG are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash

[VERSE 1]
AM7                            Bm7
  Used to spend my nights at a bar room
         DM7          D#o7      AM7
  Liquor was the only love I've known
AM7                         F#7              Bm7
  But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
                 DM7       D#o7          AM7
  And brought me back from being too far gone

[CHORUS 1]
            AM7   A7                 Bm7
  You're as smooth, as Tennessee whiskey
            DM7 Do7             AM7
  You're as sweet as strawberry wine
            AM7       F#7      Bm7
  You're as warm as a glass of brandy
                   DM7            D#o7          AM7  E7
  And honey I stay stoned on your lovin all the time

[VERSE 2]
AM7                                     Bm7
  Iâ€™ve looked for love in all the wrong places
           DM7                                     AM7
  And I've found the bottom of the bottle's always dry
AM7                       F#7                 Bm7
  But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
                      DM7       D#o7             AM7
  Cause there nothing like your lovin to keep me high

[CHORUS 2]
  E7        AM7   A7                 Bm7
  You're as smooth, as Tennessee whiskey
            DM7 Do7             AM7
  You're as sweet as strawberry wine
            AM7       F#7      Bm7
  You're as warm as a glass of brandy
                   DM7            D#o7           AM7    B7
  And honey I stay stoned on your lovin' all the time, oh

[BRIDGE]
  A                A/G                      D/F#            D
  Look boo, I know that you're not here for me, but here we are
       Bm7                  G7             AM7  A7     Bm7     C#m7     A
  All along, where did I go wrong, too far gone, y-you, y-you, y-you, y-you
A/G                             D/F#           D
  You should just stay clear of me, I'm a lost cause
            Bm7                            G7      AM7
  You're so strong, but I left you on your own, so wrong

                B       Bm       A                          B      Bm      A
  Cause all the times I said I'd quit for you, just doesn't matter all the shit that I did to you
                 B          Bm        A               F#m7             Bm7     E7
  If I had three wishes baby, I would wish that you'd give me one more chance, oh
                 B          Bm     A                                   B        Bm      A
  And all of the times that I said I'm done with this, that's when the same old shit got done again
               G#m       D#o7           F7         F#7             B7   D         AM7
  I would just take your heart and just run with it - that's not romance, but you know

  You're as warm as a glass of brandy
                   DM7            D#o7           AM7    B7 Do7 A
  And honey I stay stoned on your lovin' all the time, ohh oh oh

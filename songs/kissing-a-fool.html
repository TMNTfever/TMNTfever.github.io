[VERSE 1]
          D    D#o  
  You are far, when I could have been your star
Em7                          Gm6                      A7
  You listened to people who scared you to death, and from my heart
  D                                      D7/7        B7
  Strange that you were strong enough to even make a start
             Em7                             A#7            A7
  But you'll never find peace of mind Till you listen to your heart
  D       D#o                               Em7
  People, you can never change the way they feel
      Gm6             A7                D
  You better let them do just what they will
C6         B7                    Em7        Gm6        A7
  But they will, if you let them steal your heart from you

[CHORUS 1]
  D            D#o           B7           Em7
  People, will always make a lover feel a fool
          Gm6      A7        D
  But you knew that I loved you
C6   B7                    Em7
  We could have shown them all
     A#7         A7        D  DM7  D7
  We should have seen love through
      Em7                              A7
  You fooled me with the tears in your eyes
      Em7                        A7
  You covered me with kisses and lies
          A#7             G7            C6  A7
  So good-bye, but please don't take my heart

[VERSE 2]
          D        D#o  
  You are far, I'm never gonna be your star
Em7                           Gm6     A7
  I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
  D                              D7/7                B7
  Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start
           Em7                               A#7          A7
  But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart
  D       D#o                               Em7
  People, you can never change the way they feel
      Gm              A7                D  
  You better let them do just what they will
C6         B7                    Em7        Gm6  A7
  For they will, if you let them steal your heart

[CHORUS 2]
  D            D#o           B7           Em7
  People, will always make a lover feel a fool
          Gm6      A7        D
  But you knew that I loved you
C6   B7                    Em7
  We could have shown them all
     A#7         A7        D  D6
  We should have seen love through
 
 
[Bridge]
      Em7
But remember this, every other kiss,
         A#7
That you ever give, long as we both live
         D                D
When you need the hand of another man
        C            B7
One you really can surrender with
       Em7
I will wait for you, like I always do
        A#7                    A7      Bm7
There's something there, that can't compare
     Em7       A7
With any other
 
 
[Verse 3]
D
You are far
D#o  
When I could have been your star
Em7
You listened to people
    A#5                       A5
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
D                 DM7  
Strange that I was wrong enough
   C7                 B7
To think you'd love me too
 
 
[Outro]
  A#7            A7   D      B9
I guess you were kissing a fool
    A#7            A7       DM7  
You must have been kissing a fool

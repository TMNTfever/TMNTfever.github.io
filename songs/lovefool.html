[Verse]
 
                  Dm
Dear I feel we're facing a problem
G              Cmaj7
You love me no longer I know and
Am             Dm                G
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
            Cmaj7
To make you do
 
Am            Dm
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
G               Cmaj7           Am
Said I ought to stick to another man
           Dm
A man that surely deserves me
G           Cmaj7
I think you do
 
(Pre-chorus)
C A
Dm   B7    E
So I cry I pray and I beg
A       D      Bm          E
Love me love me say that you love me
A       D      Bm       E
Fool me fool me go on and fool me
A       D         Bm           E
Love me love me pretend that you love me
A       D           Bm                  E
Leave me leave me just say that you need me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F#m
     Bm  E     A       D   E
So I cry and I beg for you to
A       D      Bm          E
Love me love me say that you love me
A       D      Bm          E
Leave me leave me say that you need me
Am      Dm        E            Am
I can't care 'bout anything but you
 
 
[Verse] (same as 1 st verse)
Am            Dm
Lately I have desperately wondered
G               Cmaj7
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
Am                Dm              G
What I could have done in another way
            Cmaj7
To make you stay
Am              Dm
Reason will not teach a solution
G             Cmaj7
I will end up lost in confusion
Am              Dm
I don't care if you really care
G                    Cmaj7
As long as you don't go
 
 
(Pre-chorus)

Fool me fool me go on and fool me

Love me love me pretend that you love me

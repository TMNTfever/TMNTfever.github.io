<span>[VERSE 1]</span>
  Am7               Dm7
  Dear I feel we're facing a problem
  G7              CM7
  You love me no longer I know and
  Am7             Dm7                G7
  Maybe there is nothing that I can do
               C
  To make you do
Am7                  Dm7
  Mama tells me that I shouldn't bother
G7                    CM7           Am7
  Said I ought to stick to another man
              Dm7
  A man that surely deserves me
G7                 C  CM7
  But I think you do


<span>[REFRAIN 1]</span>
C#o7   Dm    D#o7       E+7
  So I cry I pray and I beg you


<span>[CHORUS 1]</span>
  AM7              DM7
  Love me love me say that you love me
C#m7             Bm7        E7
  Fool me fool me go on and fool me
AM7                   DM7
  Love me love me pretend that you love me
C#m7               Bm7                E7
  Leave me leave me just say that you need me
AM7    DM7        C#m7        C#7     Cm7 E7
  So I cry, and I pray, and I beg for you to
  AM7              DM7
  Love me love me say that you love me
C#m7               Bm7           E7
  Leave me leave me say that you need me
  A       Dm         E+7
  I can't care 'bout anything but


<span>[VERSE 2]</span>
  Am7            Dm7
  Lately I have desperately wondered
G7                    CM7
  Spent my nights awake and I wonder
   Am7               Dm7             G7
  What I could have done in another way
              C
  To make you stay
       Am7             Dm7
  Well reason will not lead to solution
G7              CM7
  I will end up lost in confusion
Am7               Dm7
  I don't care if you really care
G7                      C  CM7
  As long as you don't go

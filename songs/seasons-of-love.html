[VERSE 1]

  Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
  Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear
  Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
  How do you measure, measure a year
  In daylights, in sunsets
  In midnights, in cups of coffee
  In inches, in miles
  In laughter, in strife
  In five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
  How do you measure a year in the life


[CHORUS 1]
  How about love
  How about love
  How about love
  Measure in love
  Seasons of love
  Seasons of love


[VERSE 2]
  Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
  Five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan
  Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes
  How do you measure the life of a woman or a man
  In truths that she learned, or in times that he cried
  In bridges he burned, or the way that she died
  It's time now to sing out
  Though the story never ends
  Let's celebrate
  Remember a year in the life of friends

[CHORUS 2]
  Remember the love
  Remember the love
  Remember the love
  Measure in love
  Seasons of love
  Seasons of love


[OUTRO]
  Measure your life
  Measure your life in love

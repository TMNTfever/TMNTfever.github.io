[Chorus]
 
           C                         E7
Why do you build me up (build me up) Buttercup, baby
        F                             G
Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around
         C                           E7
And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby
         F                               G
When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still
       C                          C7
I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin'
    F                         Fm
You know that I have from the start
   C           G
So build me up Buttercup,
               F   C/E G/D C  G
Don't break my heart
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
          C       G                Bb        F
"I'll be over at ten," you told me time and again
             C           F
But you're late, I wait around and then
  C           G             Bb       F
I went to the door, I can't take any more
         C               F
It's not you, you let me down again
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
 F    C    Dm                G
(Hey, hey, hey!) Baby, baby, try to find
 G    Fm   Em                      A7
(Hey, hey, hey!) A little time and I'll make you happy
 F
I'll be home
          D7                          G
I'll be beside the phone waiting for you
 G
Ooo-oo-ooo, ooo-oo-ooo

[Verse 2]
 
   C         G         Bb           F
To you I'm a toy but I could be the boy you
 C                    F
Adore, if you'd just let me know
   C              G
Although you're untrue,
      Bb         F           C
I'm attracted to you all the more
         F
Why do I need you so

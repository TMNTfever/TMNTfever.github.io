[Verse 1]
G                  C  G              D
 Hey, where did we go days when the rain came
G             C       G        D
 Down in the hollow playing a new game
G                 C
 Laughing, and a running, hey, hey
G                D
 Skipping and a jumping
G                C
 In the misty morning fog,
       G    D                    C     D                G    Em
 with our hearts a thumpin' and you,     my brown eyed girl
C       D           G     D
You, my brown eyed girl
 
[Verse 2]
G         C       G              D
Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
G                  C               G        D
Going down to the old mine with a transistor radio
G                C
Standing in the sunlight laughing
G                D
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
G                C
Slipping and a sliding
G               D7
All along the waterfall
      C   D7               G    Em
With you,   my brown eyed girl
C       D         G     D
You, my brown eyed girl
 
[Bridge]
         D7
Do you remember when we used to sing
G         C        G        D7
Sha la la la la la la la te da   Just like that
G         C        G        D7        G
Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da
 
[Verse 3]
G           C
So hard to find my way,
G               D
  Now that I'm all on my own
G          C
I saw you just the other day,
G        D
  My how you have grown
G               C
Cast my memory back there, Lord
G           D
  Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout
G                    C
Making love in the green grass
G          D7           C
Behind the stadium with you
D7             G       Em
My brown eyed girl
C     D7          G    D
You my brown eyed girl
 
[Bridge]
         D7
Do you remember when we used to sing
(Repeat till fade)
G         C        G        D7
Sha la la la la la la la te da
G         C        G        D7        G
Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da

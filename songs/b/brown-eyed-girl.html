<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
G                  C  G              D
  Hey where did we go, days when the rains came
G             C      G            D
  Down in the hollow, playing a new game
G                C               G               D
  Laughing and a running hey hey, skipping and a jumping
G                C         G            D                 C 
  In the misty morning fog, with our hearts a-thumpin' and you
D                G Em C        D              G  D
  My brown eyed girl,  you're my brown eyed girl
 
<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
G             C     G          D
  Whatever happened, Tuesdays so slow
G                   C              G           D
  Going down to the old mine with a transistor radio
G                 C                  G                  D
  Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind a rainbow's wall
G             C       G           D7             C
  Kissing and hugging, along the waterfall with you
D                G Em C        D              G  D
  My brown eyed girl,  you're my brown eyed girl

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->

  Do you remember when we used to sing
G            C          G            D7
  Sha-la la-la la-la la la-la la-te-da
G            C          G            D7
  Sha-la la-la la-la la la-la la-te-da

<s->[VERSE 3]</s-> NEEDS WORK NEEDS WORK NEEDS WORK NEEDS WORK
  G           C          G               D
  So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
  G          C                 G        D
  I saw you just the other day, my how you have grown
  G               C              G           D
  Cast my memory back there lord, sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout
  G                    C         G          D7           C
  Making love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you
  D                G Em C        D              G  D
    My brown eyed girl,  you're my brown eyed girl

<s->[VERSE 1]</s->
G                  C  G              D
  Hey where did we go, days when the rain came
G             C      G            D
  Down in the hollow, playing a new game
G                C               G               D
  Laughing and a running hey hey, skipping and a jumping
G                C         G            D                 C 
  In the misty morning fog, with our hearts a-thumpin' and you
D                G Em C        D              G  D
  My brown eyed girl,  you're my brown eyed girl
 
<s->[VERSE 2]</s->
G         C       G              D
  Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
G                  C               G        D
  Going down to the old mine with a transistor radio
G                C                  G                D
  Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind a rainbow's wall
G                C       G               D7            C
  Slipping and a sliding, all along the waterfall with you
D                G Em C        D              G  D
  My brown eyed girl,  you're my brown eyed girl

<r->[CHORUS 1]</r->
         D7
Do you remember when we used to sing
G         C        G        D7
Sha la la la la la la la te da   Just like that
G         C        G        D7        G
Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da
 
[Verse 3]
G           C
So hard to find my way,
G               D
  Now that I'm all on my own
G          C
I saw you just the other day,
G        D
  My how you have grown
G               C
Cast my memory back there, Lord
G           D
  Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout
G                    C
Making love in the green grass
G          D7           C
Behind the stadium with you
D7             G       Em
My brown eyed girl
C     D7          G    D
You my brown eyed girl
 
[Bridge]
         D7
Do you remember when we used to sing
(Repeat till fade)
G         C        G        D7
Sha la la la la la la la te da
G         C        G        D7        G
Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da

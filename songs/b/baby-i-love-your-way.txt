  Ohh baby I love your way, every day
  E  B    F#m   A
  Ohh baby I love your way, every day

[Verse 1]
  E   B/D#  C#m
  Shadows grow so long before my eyes
  A   D9
  And they're moving across the page
  E   B/D#  C#m
  Suddenly the day turns into night
  A  D9
  far away from the city

  Cause your love won't wait

  I wanna be with you night and day

[Verse 2]
  E   B/D#    C#m
  Moon appears to shine and light the sky
  A   D9
  With the help from some firefly
  E   B/D#  C#m
  Wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
  A  D9
  I can see them under the pine

[Pre-chorus]
  G#m  C#m
  But don't hesitate
  F#m   B
  Cause your love won't wait

  A G#m F#m

[Verse 3]
  E   B/D#  C#m
  I can see the sunset in your eyes
  A   D9
  Brown and grey and blue besides
  E   B/D#  C#m
  Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
  A    D9
  I wish I could buy one, out of season

  Cause your love won't wait

Take me back to my roots, if you mix it they will come oh yeah
We'll drink it under the moon, we can mix it till the morning comes

Sitting here, in this circle, awaiting my turn
Fill this cup to the rim, yes, thats it, another splash
Gimme an extra dip from your Kumete, oh yeah

[CHORUS 1]
Take me back to my roots, if you mix it they will come oh yeah
We'll drink it under the moon, we can mix it till the morning comes

I left at 6 o'Clock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9

Warming up to ya, wanna get to know ya
It had to be fate, from the moment I saw ya
Please, stir it for me if you would, cause you look so good
You make it taste good, baby please if you could

Take me back to my roots, if you mix it they will come oh yeah
We'll drink it under the moon, we can mix it till the morning comes

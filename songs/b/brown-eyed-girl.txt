[INTRO] x 2
  G  C  G  D

[VERSE 1]
G                  C  G              D
  Hey where did we go, days when the rains came
G             C      G            D
  Down in the hollow, playing a new game
G                C             G               D
  Laughing and a running ho ho, skipping and a jumping
G                C         G            D                   C
  In the misty morning fog, with our hearts a-thumpin' and you
D7               G Em C        D              G  D  D7
  My brown eyed girl,  you're my brown eyed girl

[VERSE 2]
G             C     G          D
  Whatever happened, Tuesdays so slow
G                   C              G           D
  Going down to the old mine with a transistor radio
G                 C                  G                  D
  Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind a rainbow's wall
G             C       G           D              C
  Kissing and hugging, along the waterfall with you
D7               G Em C        D              G
  My brown eyed girl,  you're my brown eyed girl

D            D7       -
  Do you remember when we used to sing
G            C          G            D7
  Sha-la la-la la-la la la-la la-te-da
G            C          G            D7        G
  Sha-la la-la la-la la la-la la-te-da, la-te-da

[VERSE 3]
G               C        G             D
  So hard to find my way, now that I'm on my own
G                    C         G          D
  I saw you just the other day, my how you have grown
G              C         G                  D
  Can't stop remembering, sometimes I'm overcome just thinking 'bout-
  G                  C           G             D           C
  Making love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you
D7               G Em C        D              G
  My brown eyed girl,  you're my brown eyed girl

G            C          G            D7        G
  Sha-la la-la la-la la la-la la-te-da, la-te-da
G            C          G            D7
  Sha-la la-la la-la la la-la la-te-da

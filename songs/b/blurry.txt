[VERSE 1]
                   G                        A                     Bm                       Bm
  Everything’s so blurry and everyone’s so fake, and everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
                   G                         A                        B                             B
  Preoccupied without you, I cannot live at all, my whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

                    G                       A                           Bm                          Bm
  You could be my someone you could be my scene, you know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
                      G                          A                          B                           B
  I wonder what your doing, I imagine where you are, there’s oceans in between us but that’s not very far

[CHORUS 1]
          G                         A                          B                          B
  Can you take it all away, can you take it all away, when you shoved it in my face, this pain you gave to me
          G                         A                          B                    B
  Can you take it all away, can you take it all away, when you shoved it in my face

[VERSE 2]
                 G                                    A                       Bm                            Bm
  Everyone is changing, there’s no one left that’s real, to make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
                        G                          A                       B                             B
  Cause I was lost without you, I cannot live at all, my whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

                    G                       A                          Bm                          Bm
  You could be my someone you could be my scene, you know that I will save you from all of the obscene
                     G                        A                          B                           B
  I wonder what your doing, wonder where you are, there’s oceans in between us but that’s not very far

  Can you take it all away, can you take it all away, when you shoved it in my face, this pain you gave to me
          G                         A                          B                          B                  Bm  Bm  Bm  Bm
  Can you take it all away, can you take it all away, when you shoved it in my face, this pain you gave to me

[BRIDGE}
(Bm)  G                                A
  Oh, nobody told me what you thought, nobody told me what to say
  Bm                                 Bm
  Everyone showed you where to turn, told you when to run away
  G                              A
  Nobody told you where to hide, nobody told you what to say
  Bm                                 B
  Everyone showed you where to turn, showed you when to run away

  Can you take it all away, can you take it all away, when you shoved it in my face, this pain you gave to me
          G                         A                          B                          B
  Can you take it all away, can you take it all away, when you shoved it in my face, this pain you gave to me
   G A                       B  B
  No, this pain you gave to me

G      A                           Bm                        Bm

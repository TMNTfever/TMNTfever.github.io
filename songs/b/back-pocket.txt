[VERSE 1]
A                             Bm                  > C#m
  I know, that it's taken me all this time to say girl
                              Bm                    E7 | A
  I'm slow, so it's taken me all this time to say girl
A                             Bm                > C#m
  Tip toe, and I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
                                Bm                 E7|(C#m/E)
  Uh oh, and I hope that you know it's not too late

[CHORUS 1]
C#m/E                                          Bm/D
  Put it in my pocket, put it my pocket, in my back pocket
                                           C#m/E               Bm/D
  Put it in my pocket, in my pocket, in my back pocket, oh oh oh
        C#m/E                                           Bm/D
  And I'll put it in my pocket, put it my pocket, in my back pocket
                                           C#m/E
  Put it in my pocket, in my pocket, in my back pocket
                             Bm/D  /C# /B  /E
  And I'll read it when I'm alone

[VERSE 2]
  A                                Bm
  Do you like me-circle yes or no, on this piece of paper
                        Cm    |    C#m                                  Bm  E7 | (A)
  Cause I really really need to know, are you gonna be my fifth grade queen
  A                               Bm                                     Cm    |    C#m
  Hand it back after second hour- then I will know if you're gonna be my special flower
                                Bm   E7 | (C#m/E)
  Ooh girl, 'cause I need to know, I will

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1)
C#m/E                                          Bm/D
  Put it in my pocket, put it my pocket, in my back pocket
                                           C#m/E               Bm/D
  Put it in my pocket, in my pocket, in my back pocket, oh oh oh
        C#m/E                                           Bm/D
  And I'll put it in my pocket, put it my pocket, in my back pocket

                             Bm/D  /C# /B  /E
  And I'll read it when I'm alone

[BRIDGE]
DM7                                /A /D C#m7
  When you kissed me on the playground,   I lost my breath- I had to lay down
Fo7                        F#m  /A /G# /F# /E
  And assess what I had seen
DM7                             /A /D C#m7
  Then I had to write the words out, cause you took them out of my mouth
Fo7                          F#m    E        D    C#m Bm7  E7
  But it's hard for me to read, out loud, oh gee, oh  gosh

  I know, that it's taken me all this time to say girl
                              Bm                    E7 | A
  I'm slow, so it's taken me all this time to say girl
A                             Bm                Cm | C#m
  Tip toe, and I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
                                Bm                 E7
  Uh oh, and I hope that you know it's not too late

                                           C#m/E               Bm/D

                                           C#m/E
  Put it in my pocket, in my pocket, in my back pocket
                            Bm/D  /C# /B  /E  A | A/D | A
  And I'll read it when I'm alone

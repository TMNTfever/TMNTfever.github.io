Bm           G                C#o7                F#7
  Ridin high, when I was king, played it hard and fast cause I had everything
Bm              G              C#o7               F#7

  C#o7                                    F#7
  Anytime I seek ya ya let me know, but I planted that seed, so just let me grow

         C#o7                                            F#7
  Got my arms so spread and I'm hopin that my heart gets fed
  -
  Matter of fact, I'm beggin

[BRIDGE 1]
Bm              G          C#o7              F#7
  I need you to understand, tried so hard to be your man
Bm                    G                     C#o7                    F#7
  The kind of man you want in the end, only then - can I - begin to live again

[VERSE 2A]
Bm               G             C#o7              F#7
  An empty shell, I used to be, the shadow of my life was hangin over me
Bm             G                 C#o7                  F#7
  A broken man, but I don't know, won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

[VERSE 2B]
          Bm                            G

         C#o7                                    F#7
  Why we got good shit don't embrace it, why the feel for the need to replace me
            Bm                                                 G
  Ya on the one-way track from the good, I want my paint in ya picture, anyway we could be at
         C#o7                                         F#7
  But my heart's in the trash like it should, you done gave it away, you had it til you took it back
       Bm                               G                                             C#o7
  But I keep walkin on, keep rockin dawns, keep walking forward, now the court is yours
                                          F#7
  Keep browsin halls, cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, I'm beggin

[BRIDGE 2]
Bm                    G           C#o7                F#7

Bm                 G               C#o7                     F#7
  I'm holdin on, I can't fall back, I'm just a con about to fade to black

[VERSE 1]
  Am                                                   F
  First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
                   E7                                Am
  I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been-oh, ooh-ooh
                           F            E7
  The way that things have been-oh, ooh-ooh

  Am                                                               F
  Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I can be
                     E7                         Am
  I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea-oh, ooh-ooh
                   F           E7
  The master of my sea-oh, ooh-ooh

[PRE-CHORUS 1]
        Am
  I was broken from a young age, taking my sulking to the masses
             F                                     E7
  Writing my poems for the few, that looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
               Am
  Singing from heartache, from the pain, take up my message from the veins
              F                                 E7
  Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the-

[CHORUS 1]
  Am                                   F         E7
  Pain, you made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Am                                            F         E7
  Pain, you break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
  Am                                        F
  Pain, oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
     E7
  My life, my love, my drive, they came from-
  Am                                   F         E7
  Pain, you made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[VERSE 3]
  Am                                                F
  Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
                           E7                                Am
  All the hate that you've heard-has turned your spirit to a dove-oh, ooh-ooh
                  F            E7
  Your spirit up above-oh, ooh-ooh

[PRE-CHORUS 2]
        Am
  I was choking in the crowd, building my rain up in the cloud
               F                              E7
  Falling like ashes to the ground, hoping my feelings, they would drown
           Am
  But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited
                         F                      E7
  Till it broke open and rained down, it rained down, like-

[CHORUS 2] (Same as Chorus 1)
  Am                                   F         E7
  Pain, you made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Am                                            F         E7
  Pain, you break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
  Am                                        F
  Pain, oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
     E7
  My life, my love, my drive, they came from-
  Am                                   F         E7
  Pain, you made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[VERSE 2]
  Am                                                 F
  Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
                         E7                      Am
  You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins-oh, ooh-ooh
                  F             E7
  The blood in my veins-oh, ooh-ooh

[PRE-CHORUS 3] (Same as 2nd half of Pre-Chorus 2)
           Am
  But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited
                         F                      E7
  Till it broke open and rained down, it rained down, like-

Am                                            F         E7
  Pain, you break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
  Am                                        F
  Pain, oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain

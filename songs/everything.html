[VERSE 1]
                D                      E7
  You're a falling star, you're the getaway car
              G          A              D
  You're the line in the sand when I go too far
                   D                E7
  You're the swimming pool, on an August day
                 G       A          D
  And you're the perfect thing to say
  
               D                   E7
  And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute
               G               A            D
  Ah, when you smile at me you know exactly what you do
             D                       E7
  Baby don't pretend, that you don't know it's true
                G             A       D
  Cause you can see it when I look at you

[CHORUS 1]
              G A     D                     G A    D
  And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
       D7         G       F#      Bm7
  It's you, it's you, you make me sing
                E7                  Gm              D
  You're every line, you're every word, you're everything

VERSE 2:
             D                  E7
  You're a carousel, you're a wishing well
                G     A              D
  And you light me up, when you ring my bell
              D                   E7
  You're a mystery, you're from outerspace
               G            A    D
  You're every minute of my everyday
  
       D                      E7
  And I can't believe, uh that I'm your man
       G               A           D
  And I get to kiss you baby just because I can
          D                        E7
  Whatever comes our way, ah we'll see it through
         G                    A        D
  And you know that's what our love can do

[CHORUS 2]
              G A     D                     G A    D
  And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
       D7         G       F#      Bm7
  It's you, it's you, you make me sing
                E7                  Gm              D
  You're every line, you're every word, you're everything

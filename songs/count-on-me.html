  If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
        Am           G         F
  I'll sail the world to find you 
         C                                                  Em
  If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
        Am         G          F
  I'll be the light to guide you

  And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2, you'll be there
        F                                          C

      F                 C
I'll sing a song beside you
 C                                          Am

Everyday I will remind you, oh

[INTRO]
  D  D#o  Em7  Gm6  A7

[VERSE 1]
          D    D#o
  You are far, when I could have been your star
Em7                          Gm6                      A7
  You listened to people who scared you to death, and from my heart
  D                                      F#o         B7
  Strange that you were strong enough to even make a start
             Em7                             A#7            A7
  But you'll never find peace of mind Till you listen to your heart
  D       D#o                               Em7
  People, you can never change the way they feel
      Gm6             A7                D
  You better let them do just what they will
C6         B7                    Em7        Gm6        A7
  But they will, if you let them steal your heart from you

[CHORUS 1]
  D            D#o           B7           Em7
  People, will always make a lover feel a fool
          Gm6      A7        D
  But you knew that I loved you
C6   B7                    Em7
  We could have shown them all
     A#7         A7        D  DM7  D7
  We should have seen love through
      Em7                              A7
  You fooled me with the tears in your eyes
      Em7                        A7
  You covered me with kisses and lies
          A#7             G7            C6  A7
  So good-bye, but please don't take my heart

[VERSE 2]
          D        D#o
  You are far, I'm never gonna be your star
Em7                           Gm6     A7
  I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
  D                              C6                  B7
  Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start
           Em7                               A#7          A7
  But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart
  D       D#o                               Em7
  People, you can never change the way they feel
      Gm6             A7                D
  You better let them do just what they will
C6         B7                    Em7        Gm6  A7
  For they will, if you let them steal your heart

[CHORUS 2]
  D            D#o           B7           Em7
  People, will always make a lover feel a fool
Gm6        A7               D
  But you knew that I loved you
C6   B7                    Em7
  We could have shown them all
     A#7         A7        D  D6
  We should have seen love through

[BRIDGE]
        Em7
  But remember this, every other kiss,
           A#7
  That you ever give, long as we both live
           D
  When you need the hand of another man
          C            B7
  One you really can surrender with
         Em7           Gm6
  I will wait for you, like I always do
          C6                    B7
  There's something there, that can't compare
       Em7 A7
  With any other

[VERSE 3]
          D    D#o
  You are far, when I could have been your star
Em7                          Gm6                      A7
  You listened to people who scared you to death, and from my heart
  D                  DM7             C6                  B7
  Strange that I was wrong enough to think you'd love me too

[OUTRO]
    A#7            A7        D B9
  I guess you were kissing a fool
      A#7            A7        D9
  You must have been kissing a fool

Bm                         G                A
  I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
Bm                     G                A
  I left my body lyin  somewhere in the sands of time
Bm                                  G                A
  I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
Bm                              G  A
  I feel there's nothing I can do,  yeah
